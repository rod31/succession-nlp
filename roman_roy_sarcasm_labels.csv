"Hey hey hey, motherfuckers!",
My guy? Are you saging?,
"Right, bad juju. Maybe you should make a move, dude?",
I think just fuck off thanks. How’s it going?,
"Of course I’m okay. Obviously I’m okay. Why do you ask? What here? Oh, man, I’m so over all this. I was a bad fit. I was never a corporate cock-suck anyway. Besides. I never got this high in the fucking building! They stuck me in LA with Old Father Time, we were the pool boys, right, Frank. Fucking banana cabana? So. What’s the bid?",
"What that’s ‘commercially sensitive’ – I’m still on the board, bro!",
One-twenty-five! Fuck!?,
"Hey, Global Tom! How you shaking? You still fucking shit up for us?",
Sis. The pols still boring the living shit out of you?,
Ha! Look at you.* Walking around like you’re an actual human person!,
Yeah you wish!,
"Happy birthday, Dad.",
O-kay! Now the fucking’s started!  you’re getting fucked!,
PPG are balls deep in him. Hustling up a rival bid.,
"You know, I think the only thing worse for us than buying that piece of shit would be trying and losing.",
Well that’s unnecessary!,
It’s a – goo? Is it goo?,
.,
He wants some sourdough tips!,
"Dude, he’s gonna love it. He can let it rise while he does his yoga?",
What’s the deal?,
he—,
Well excuse me if I don’t want him to (die)—,
"Read the small print, asshole!",
Oh fuck!!,
I’m not even laughing – what?,
"Hey! What the fuck? Off the cloth, moth! Private! We’re not fourteen, dude!",
"We all need advice, man—",
"Oh, dude, come on—",
"Suck-up. ‘Gee you’re so great, Double-Vote-Power Mom!’",
Oh sure. I’m sure.,
"So? Well, you know. I guess, I want to do anything for you. . But—",
"No. God no. It’s your firm, Dad. It’s not ‘what’s in it for me’. But you know, what  in it for me?",
"Sure. Sure. It was just tough last time.  tough, with Frank over me, in LA.",
"Oh sure. I understand. It’s just, at the studio I had ideas, I’m quite an innovative thinker, but I found a certain amount of resistance?",
"No, what? ? It’s not about one great idea. It was a culture. I think he was maybe threatened by my energy?",
"Oh, I don’t know. You know me, I think we should liquidate. Financialize. Who wants pipes and product. When you can float hot with pure cash?",
"But if not. I’d wanna run the show. But, till that opened up. Chief Operating Officer. But I guess, that’s Frank?",
"Uh-huh, it  depend.",
"Plus, do you want to tell Dad no?",
Can we think about it?,
If Kendall’s going we need one more to make it fair!  You wanna?,
"C’mon. You’re up. Relax. Can you hit a ball? Cos I’ll give you a million dollars if you hit a home run, kid. I don’t know why you’re smiling. Seriously. A million.",
"Grace, where’s my—",
Oh you don’t want him incentivized! One million dollars for a home run.,
What’s the Frank situation?,
Yeah? Fuck.,
Um? Shiv?,
Um? Con?,
It’s not sufficiently attractive. As a proposition.,
Dad? It’s just a first position?,
Dad!,
What?,
"She said, ‘You’re my favorite, don’t tell Shiv.’ What do you think? She asked what happened. So I told her.",
"Thanks, big man. Huge relief.",
"Excuse me, are we in the best part of the hospital? Sorry – but we need to—",
Well he’s not dying.,
He did.,
Should we call Mom?,
I don’t know. It was freaky.,
"Yep, one second Shiv was hardballing Dad, the next he mumbled something and – you know.",
Someone said brain hemorrhage? Right?,
"Umm, the first – the ambulance guy?",
According to this it sounds like a stroke. Could be an acute subdural hematoma.,
Is it nice?,
PJ says Aziz Khan at the Mayo Clinic is the best there is.,
"Uh-huh, interesting. You think this is a good time to get him to stop biting his nails?",
He’s fine. It’s a fucking power-nap. Medical siesta.,
It’s fine. He’ll never retire and he’ll never die.,
You know Connor’s invited Willa down?,
"I don’t know. He saw an empty bed and it made him horny? I have no idea. — But listen, so I was thinking – this must be tough on Marcia.",
"No, look I know the trust only comes into play if certain things happen—",
"But I was thinking, wouldn’t it be nice for Dad to wake up and for us all to have signed, like he wanted? A nice gesture?",
"So, for the record, you’re declining to sign the change of trust?",
Okay. It just seems a bit shitty. Under the circumstances … ?,
"Well, you did make her husband’s brain explode …",
"We’re here for you, Marcia.",
"Oh just rumors, ‘taken to the hospital’. Some of Twitter says he’s dead. A good deal of – of – rejoicing at our father’s potential demise. Can you screengrab these fuckers who are saying shit?",
Scan. And the news is out.,
"Well Frank was fired, so?",
They’re gonna give us the results?,
He’s not an ‘older patient’.,
"But physically, he’s basically still in his seventies. And he’s in great shape. Thirty years.",
So I asked Greg to bring the change of trust—,
"—and when he brings them, we should sign them.",
"I’m sorry but even if we were talking about it, which we’re not, it wouldn’t necessarily be you, bro.",
I don’t know. Anyone. It could be me.,
Dad just made me COO?,
"Well, I think he was.",
I don’t see it that way.,
Are you saying I’m a dipshit?,
"Fuck you! He’s alive, you’re not the fucking boss—",
‘Control the narrative’. You probably yell that when you cum.,
"Oh no, the law? We couldn’t possibly break the law.",
It has. I feel sorry for him.,
"Yeah, right, that’s the flow.",
That’s right.,
"No, he does not need that.",
"Well, I’m not looking for it but I guess I’m already COO so another small step and—?",
Because?,
I don’t know what that means?,
"It doesn’t matter who does it, it’s temporary, anyone will do.",
Prick. Eva?,
Basically dead.,
So who? Someone Dad trusts. Dad doesn’t trust anyone. Apart from Frank. And he fired Frank for shits and giggles. Gerri?,
I like the sound of that.,
"Dad fired you, man.",
"He said that to be nice. What he meant was: You’re not up to it, and it’s going to be someone else.",
"Well you do kind of need it, really?",
Bravo. It was an excellent impression.  CONNOR I just want to say – I’m not getting involved.,
"Greg, how are you doing?",
"Listen, you’re at the apartment, right?",
"I know you’re getting PJs and all that shit. Just, pick up a sweater maybe. Also. My dad’s, okay?",
"Doesn’t matter. Not something washed. Something he’s worn, maybe, if you find one.",
"Just smell it. Okay. Jesus. I just want something that smells of him, okay. I just want that. Is that enough for you?",
"So, Gerri. How you doing?",
Baird?,
Ohh. Does he – with the tortoise?,
"Yeah. Of course! How is he? Yeah, no I do, I remember. Anyhoo thanks, for captaining us through this shitstorm. You do a good job, Gerri. You are a real good job-doer, my friend. Look, I’m not great at the whole corporate flirt, I’d rather just lube up and fuck, you know?",
"Yeah – so, look, for me and Shiv the Kendall thing doesn’t work, so we’re thinking. General Counsel, you know where the bodies are buried, you probably buried them ‘ha-ha’, so, you’d have the family’s support to step in and take the reins. Okay?",
Right. Can I ask why?,
"Okay. But— Gerri, excuse me but I’ve always thought of you, and I mean this in the best possible way, as a stone-cold killer bitch?",
Tortoises and lube.,
I thought I was a fuckhead?,
You said I wasn’t serious.,
And Shiv?,
Okay – I’m not uninterested.,
Only thing … Gerri turned down the top job. Does that mean something?,
No.,
It was mooted.,
Actual COO.,
"I said, why not?",
"Sis, please. I’m trying to bring us together here. I’m mediating.",
"Dude, Karl’s not going to—",
"Hey, cuz, you got the papers?",
"Look forward to working with you, bro.",
"Night, Dad. See you soon.",
A seven.,
"Okay well, I trust Pax. Pax says you’re the best.",
"He’s a prick. But he knows the best places. He’s the only person I trust on food. So I thought, I should trust him on, like, the opposite of food.",
"Dude, no need for the speech, I’m down.",
Serious as cancer. Seriouser. Fucking— money cancer. I gotta check out. I’m rolling COO now.,
"Operating Officer. Waystar Royco. If it operates, I chief it. Five-thirty is perfect.",
"Sure. Cool. Because the other five-thirty I’ll be – being an agent of change and you know, sacking people.",
A six?,
Argh! I think you popped something.,
Fuuuuuuuuck! That was brutal.,
Of course I was in! I’m COO.,
"Relax, bro. New trainer. It’ll be okay.",
"Fine, dude, I was only trying to be nice, that was a fucking shit show and you handled it like a moron is the truth.",
Fuck you.,
I have a pitch?,
How is he?,
"Well that’s good, right?",
She thinks Marcia’s poisoning him.,
"What, not including me?",
"Sure. For like five minutes. He was – he was pretty – you know, it wasn’t really ‘him’, him. There were tubes.",
Should we take twenty?,
Hey. I’m going to stand. Back. New trainer.,
Yowch— .,
He’s like a thousand percent better though. He’s like a bull in rhino hide.,
This morning he put on a sock. So.,
"Internet. Fucking game-changer, baby.",
VR could be a lifeboat?,
Porn could be a lifeboat?,
"Yeah on that, ‘the new regime’? Forgive me for whoring in but shouldn’t I be in there as well?",
"And in that equation, I’m the mud?",
What happened?,
What did you say?,
You heard?,
With me it’s usually – ‘Who was that maniac who put a watermelon on his dick?’,
"Hey, it’s me too, man. Don’t leave me out.",
Can I suggest something?,
Can I suggest we all take our shirts off?,
You know I beat off in my office earlier?,
"You know, we can be a pair of little fucking worms wriggling around in here – do what the button-down fuckheads say. No offense, Gerri.",
"Seriously, man. They could write an algorithm to run this place. But that’s not the answer. Break shit up. Disrupt. Yeah?",
"Or. What about, next-wave shit. Prop-co op-co. Turn group finance into a profit centre?",
"Hey if you’re gonna shit on every idea, I got places I could be.",
Poor Tom. Boo-hoo.,
"Maybe we cut a title or two, from physical production. Newspaper- wise? Online only?",
"Yum yum, blood! See – shirt-off shit?",
I guess we should ask – or tell—,
"I mean we should at least , right?",
"I just thought we were doing our plan, man. Shirts-off shit?",
B-man!,
"From up here, all the fucking ants, you can almost imagine they’re people, right?",
"Well here’s the thing, Brex, I can’t run today because my back has been fucked since Monday.",
"I assume you’re insured? I mean, I’m doing big shit, big big shit every day and so like losing even a quarter of a percent of my operating capacity, that has million- dollar implications. And I’m thinking, maybe, test case, I throw three or four dozen white-shoe lawyers at you and see what it would be like to actually physically destroy someone?",
"Fuck you – look at you, are you okay? No. I’m just saying, you need to take this seriously?",
Fuck you!,
Fuck you.,
Uh-huh. Thank you.,
Gracey? I’m trying to clean my fucking teeth here?,
"It’s quite a haunting image, isn’t it? The eye almost seems to follow you around the room?",
"You know your future senator? Apparently, this is her husband’s asshole.",
"He posted it himself. With the words, ‘Check out my asshole.’ On a website called Filthy Rich. For married people who want to fuck around.",
Um – just us I believe right now. Leak to ATN. My pal thought I’d be intrigued.,
Umm feisty!,
"Way below my level, Shiv. But my guess is, why not, a little? It’s dirty, it’s weird. And it’s evidence of precisely the sort of disgusting liberal metro butt-love that makes our viewership angry enough to buy pharmaceuticals.",
"Oh it’s worse than that, Shiv, I’d say, it’s – it’s – malicious.",
"Uh-huh. Would you actually say, it’s like we’re ‘partisan surrogates subverting the democractic process which underpins our whole way of life’.",
"Back where, what? Back in the chair?",
‘Good’? You’d love it if his brain fell out the back of his head!,
"You’re scared in case he’s going to push you out and your plans for you – know, Uber for news, Facebook for cats? Fucking open-plan office you on a dance platform jerking off idea gloop into – ‘think boxes’—",
Got to go.,
Frank?,
"Well correction – it’s not a good morning from my POV because you’re here, and I hate you.",
What the fuck is going on?,
"The fucking, the – the Weasel Prevails. That would be a good name for your autobiography – if they did books by, jerks.",
You’re pathetic.,
"Sure, man. He didn’t apologize when he hit our au pair with a car.",
Okay. You need to tell Dad to back the fuck off.,
He’s rehired Frank to babysit me and I don’t need a babysitter! Especially one I don’t get to fuck.,
"Yeah. I mean, you’re CEO, can he even do that?",
"You need to tell him to butt out. We’re running the show. Go back to bed, eat some soup. Get better.",
And what do I do with Frank?,
Thank you. Thank you. That’s good to hear. Because it’s a big job.,
If you want I could help you – we could tag-team it on Dad’s speech – at the Sad Sack Wasp Trap?,
You’re doing a joke? Fine. Who you taking?,
Doesn’t want to.,
What? How does that look? CEO can’t get an ugly sister to go to the ball?,
"Oh yeah, I’d fuck that in a minute. Ask her.",
"What a pathetic beta-cuck. ‘Would it be “cool”? Cos I got something secret in my pants, would it be okay to show please, or is that a trigger-warning, baby?’",
This isn’t a false flag is it? Did you piss on your own floor?,
"Well first, let him know where to go peepee and poopoo.",
You’re kidding?,
"Just another Saturday night, baby.",
"Dad, I don’t want to shit-talk Kendall. ‘He’s not up to the job’— but I think I speak for everyone when I say it’s great to see you back.",
"But – one thing, and I don’t mind, it’s fine. But I wanted to say – Frank is what to me now?",
But why?,
How do you mean—?,
"Well, I’ll press Tom? What? I’ve been waiting for Tom to get his feet fully under the table — The guy is a bit of a flake is the truth. But leave it with me. When are you coming back in again?",
"Uh-huh, but what does that mean?",
"Hi, don’t mean to intrude? Hold on, buddy. Thanks?",
"Well thank you, Grace, you delightful speaking timepiece.",
"Dude, if you like her that much why don’t you ask for her fucking number?",
"You clearly want to, right? Do you want to give him your number?",
"Dude, ask for her fucking number?",
He’s retiring? He’s a lizard?,
Dude? This is our charity. How much a plate? You’ve got to get at least a blowjob. That’s the law.,
"Well it’s the ethical code. I hate to say this, but she has behaved rather unethically here.",
"No one watches TV, Dad.",
Yeah. But not really.,
"Do all the news? Well, Kim Jong Pop, because that’s not how things work in this country.",
What? Sure. Who doesn’t. More than you’d think. A billion?,
Fuck you.,
"Fuck you. You fucking, piece of shit.",
"No! What the fuck. I think I’ve made it pretty fucking clear I need a modicum of space once every twenty-four hours! Fucking come in, my heart rate’s dropping like a stone anyway!",
"What, Dad? Sure. He just kept pouring. It just went everywhere. It was like he didn’t even see?",
"Local TV, local news? Here’s a local news story for you: ‘Elderly Local Man Doesn’t Notice He’s Getting Butt-Fucked By Google’.",
"Did you hear the way he talked to me? That was the tone, whole time I was at the studio.",
Who knows how many people live in Indonesia? I mean who even cares? Fuck Indonesia. It sounds like a medical condition.,
"How many people live up your ass, Father Dickmas?",
You gonna do something.,
"You should. And the only way he’ll respect you is if you try to destroy him. Because in your position, that’s exactly what he would try to do.",
The Thursday box office is trickling in and it’s . How is that possible?,
"Happy Thanksgiving to my favorite stepmom. Remember. No tongues, Mom!",
It’s just depressing is all.,
Hey. What are you up to?,
Are you smoking weed?,
Do you want to?,
Watch the door.,
"Oh yeah. You think I smoke schwag? Yeah, you’re gonna be  high.",
Fuck!,
. Now they think it’s going to set a fucking record for Thanksgiving box office.,
Well that’s true I never liked her.,
‘She want to take all my lovely money!’,
"This is what you’re dealing with, Shiv. This is heartland right here.",
"With Connor? Oh, that’s his whore.",
Of course he knows. He pays her to suck his cock.,
"I actually introduced them at a party a few years ago. She wasn’t a call girl then. Well, you could call her. She just hadn’t figured out she could charge.",
Happy Thanksgiving. This is my cousin Greg. He’s very excited to meet you. Would you excuse me?,
Shame I wasn’t on a percentage?,
Because I introduced you. I’d be a rich man by now! Oh. That’s right. I am anyway.,
"What? I was ironicizing. I just think it’s better to be honest about this stuff, we’re all just raking the green, baby.",
"Oh, ‘family style’, what almost like we’re a family?",
Bullshit!,
"You smoked squirrel? Grace, didn’t you try that?",
"Oh, god, please no. Wait. Did someone pay you to say that?",
"Uh-huh, you see me stamp collecting? I guess I could show you my rusty sheriff’s badge? Shiv’s got a big collection of pictures of those.",
But apart from that have you had a nice time?,
What are you doing? Who put this on?,
Why are you laughing?,
Assholes.,
"What the fuck, Grace?",
Yeah? Is it. Is it? Really?,
"Well look. Fine. But I think we have irreconcilable differences, so. I think we need to have a talk.",
"What talk? The ‘I’m sorry – insert name here – it’s just not working. I hope we can always be blah, let’s keep in blah, I’ll never forget such and such …’ That talk.",
Fuck the turkey?,
I’m thankful I wasn’t born a Siamese twin.,
"What, you would? To be like fused to someone by the chest. Or to have two bodies and one head. C’mon. Gross.",
And so say all of us!,
"Well I’m thankful you told us about that, Dad?",
Let’s hold him down and cut out his tongue.,
"You’re ‘going steady’? What are you, nine?",
"I went to the market and bought a crack pipe … What? What? Okay, okay, I bought a gimp suit … Fine. I bought a potato, a new hat, a pony, a big fat hen and this. Come on, Dad, what’s it going to be? A hot dog. China. Immortality. Huh? The soul of the nation?",
Okay. Local TV and …,
"Dad gets to buy whatever he wants. So, come on, Pop – ‘and’—",
"Clock’s ticking. Time’s running out. Local TV, and what did I say?",
"Cheating! Come on, Dad!",
"—and I’m guessing, if I say, cortado with almond you’re going to look like I’m some kind of jerk, right, here in 1982 or wherever we are?",
"Oo! Lady Macbeth, getting her little fucking screwdriver in?",
"She’s a thousand years old. What has she got, something disgusting?",
"Alright, Captain fucking Prickle. Do you need to jerk off? Because I’m getting a lot of rage here.",
"Didn’t you go on a date with her daughter? You could rekindle the flame. Flash the wang, splooge us to victory?",
Except he hates you?,
"Oh c’mon, this is bullshit. We push, Lawrence is ours. Ewan could be ours. Ilona could be ours. Gerri can’t vote but she can talk for senior management. This is done, there’s being cautious and there’s being fucking time-wasters.",
"Okay. So I take Lawrence, you firm up the others?",
"I know the guy, I see him at every fucking fakers party and phoney soft opening I go to. We’re two peas in a metrosexual think-pod. Hey. Are we doing this? Are we running a fucking company together, or what? Just because I like a joke doesn’t mean I’m a fucking clown, and just cos you look like a fucking statue doesn’t mean you’re cool?",
Oh the delicacies? The little nuances I couldn’t possibly— Lawrence hates you.,
"Relax, old man. Relax. Tomorrow we storm the castle. Using your dome as a battering ram. I’m sorry, Wambsgans, but do you have a black eye?",
"Who, the guy who jammed his dick in your eye?",
"Oh, man, that’s our sister!",
"Yeah, and I’ve got to go eat some fucking – elk or something.",
Here’s to us!,
"Look at you fucking guys! If you ever have room for a threesome, let me know!",
"So look, Lawrence. I need to ask something. But – are we cool? Do we have a level? We can see each other?",
"And we’re disrupters, yeah?",
"Right? We don’t fear change. We eat change, yeah?",
"Cool, cool. So. Can I say something? What would you say if I told you there was going to be a vote of no confidence? Tomorrow. Kick out the old man, in with the new guard. Romey and the Homey.",
It’s me and Kendall. Romey and the Homey. We storm the castle. We’re the fucking French New Wave—,
"My vision? Is like all the kids, all the black ones and the brown ones and all the white ones they all, get together and do wind power. And fuck, or something.",
Look. You know what. I ended up in a bookshop the other day and I just started to laugh?,
"Yeah, I looked at all the books cramming up all the walls and I just thought, you know, about the olden days, all the fucking monasteries and the bibles and the sermons and the ‘did Jesus say this? Or mean that?’ and all the wars and what-have-you. All . No one gives a fuck.",
"Oh, people are gonna read, but the old world it’s gone. Papers gone. ‘News’ gone. Channels gone. Big man gone. ‘Tune in to ABS at nine o’clock to get told what to think.’ No. Over. It’s all about the morsels, man, feed me the fucking tasty morsels. Keep me interested. That’s where we’re headed. Tasty morsels from groovy hubs. We need to be in the hub club.",
"Look. I’m dumb but I’m smart, okay? I’m too dumb to fix our whole company. I’ve got no attention span. This is the most interesting thing that’s happened in my whole life and I’m thinking about six other things. But I’m fucking smart enough to see what needs changing. And I’m smart enough to spot the people who can help, . So, are you in?",
Fuck. He knows. Does he know?,
He knows. Don’t go. It’s going to be horrible. He’ll chop your dick off and stuff it in your mouth.,
Did he mention me?,
He’s in.,
"Yes, for real. Fuck you.",
"Hey, man, so how are we feeling?",
Fucking nice guy. Lovely guy. We good? We solid?,
"Kendall? Where are you? We’ve already started, man, we started. What are we doing?",
Uh-huh?,
"Kendall? Ken, you there?",
"I think it’s a tough one. It’s tough, but maybe—",
Against.,
"Are you okay, Dad?",
Hey!,
We don’t know it was piss.,
I thought you weren’t talking to me?,
Oh very much the fuck. Very much the fuck indeed. The big man’s breaking down and everyone’s invited!,
Everybody.,
I’ve got to go. See you in Cuckooville.,
I need to talk to Kendall.,
He’s not available? What’s he doing? Playing with his fucking Legos? He’s nothing but available.,
"Well I know he is, so – c’mon, okay?",
Will you take a message?,
"Okay, the entertainment’s arrived! Wow, this is like the first stage of an orgy. Like kind of exciting but also super-awkward.",
"Hey, Tom.",
So where’s the actual head-doctor guy?,
I just hope he can cure your serious case of being a bitch.,
Fuck you.,
It’s ironic. Cos if anyone needs therapy it’s him.,
My guy’s surprised I made it through at all.,
I’m surprisingly well adjusted. You’re the looney tune. You’re just the best at hiding it.,
"Yeah, so, I think I’m going to reveal to him you sexually abused me.",
Yeah. You just would not stop.,
You’re the one who tried to fuck me.,
No. But – competitive advantage. Could come in handy some day!,
Me too!,
This is barely comprehensible.,
"Hi Alon, just FYI. I play it dumb but my SAT scores were off the chart. For context.",
"Oh okay. Well I guess that’s me told … ooh I feel so exposed. Please don’t brain-fuck me, Daddy.",
"You’re the expert, man.",
It is nice.,
I hear it. I hear it.,
He’s got a lot of power everywhere.,
I don’t mind.,
I don’t think you are?,
I don’t know.,
I mean he might not have meant to but – no.,
What are you doing?,
You can’t go! Can she?,
Really dive deep. Don’t be scared of what you’re going to find down there!,
Jump jump jump! You pussy!,
"The guy, his teeth— It’s bad, I dunno, maybe, someone—",
He just dived. He hit the bottom—,
"Well the teeth are in the head, Connor, they’re kind of a central feature.",
I didn’t think he’d jump head-first. Hey Karolina.,
"Jesus fucking Christ, man.",
"Yeah, you’re okay, buddy. Fuck!",
"We look good, Dad. We should talk.",
"Right, sure. And you actually want me to do that? Or is this just words we’re spewing for the camera?",
What? Where are you?,
What??,
Are you high?,
"Ken, will you send me a pin, just so I know you’re okay?",
"Just send me a fucking pin, okay? Do it now, are you doing it? I’m coming to get you, bro.",
I’m going to get Kendall. He’s … here. And – he’s not – great?,
"Hey, man? Man?",
"I’ve come to rescue you, man. Wow. Hi. I like what you’ve done with the wolves.",
"Come on, man, let’s get you out of here.",
Is that crank?,
"That will make you crash like fucking – Mohamed Atta, into – Princess Di.",
"Come on, let’s go.",
It was all bullshit. He didn’t even do it.,
"We should all meet up and do this again, I’ll make sure he stays in touch.",
You okay?,
"Should I call a doctor. Or Rava? Do you want me to hit a kid so we can steal his kidneys? Listen. I’m sorry, but I gotta do this call about the launch thing in Japan, as we go – if that’s—",
"Listen, just so you know, I think the launch thing is good. I talked to the guys—",
"Mmmm. But, trying to make his biggest enemy president  kind of a fuck-you.",
Correct.,
Yeah?,
"Good, right? Is it whisky time?",
Ugh? That’s a good price?,
"I think he wants out, fast.",
Dad. I think we did fuck him?,
"Well, objectively, I mean, if we get what we want and he gets what he wants—",
"Well, sure, I like hurting other human beings as much as the next guy but – this is, really fucking good, Dad.",
"Oh, Dad? That’s— It’s insulting.",
What – that? Oh that’s nothing.,
"I got game. Sometimes you play possum. Let him punch it out till he gets tired. Then, I move in for the kill.",
I’m maybe seeing him this weekend. If he shows.,
Fuck. Dude. I don’t suppose you know a coke dealer in Prague?,
Tom Wom bachelor party. Ugh. Ugh. I don’t have time for this shit!,
Bullshit. Rhomboid?,
Please. Because you have a nipple ring and simply will  stop going on about it?,
"Fuck you, I have a reputation. I’m not taking my crew to watch, some art pricks and some tech hoes dance around in bowler hats and twizzle their mustaches out of time to the ‘beatz’. Dude. Come on. Not the lumbar setting.",
Really? Yuch. He goes to those things?,
Sandy goes? Jesus.,
Just – hold your tingling wieners. All will become clear.,
"Oh, okay.  he deigns to join us. You’re late.",
… On coke.,
Alright! Who wants to fuck a hobo? No? Then let’s roll out. Party. Down there.,
"You should probably dump your luggage in the car. And listen, I’m really sorry, guys – but it’s a pretty tight guest list?",
"Relax, we’ll figure it out. Keep your phones on, we’ll first-wave it and call you once we’re inside. Take twenty for coffee.",
"Look. Tom, I’m sorry. Prague fell through and I was busy and I didn’t have time to organize a – hot-air balloon to Monaco.",
Yeah. I came to another thing here.,
"So, bro. Are you going to be okay to be around all the booze and coke? Because, I can make sure no one does it around you, man.",
I hear you’re ‘doing apps’.,
Wow. It’s all so futuristico.,
Hey. They’re nice pockets. Spacious.,
He’s actually got me overseeing this satellite launch out of Tanegashima.,
Plus I’m heading up the local deal. Bob Galpin’s selling and I knocked it out the park. Which was nice.,
"Okay, boys, we’re pouching.",
"Tom, we’ll figure it out. I think the big white men are going to be drinking  of diner coffee.",
"So, dude, where’s Sandy? When do we sit?",
"What did you expect? Why did you even ask me, Tom?",
Okay. This is it. Yeah? Cool right? Is it cool? Or is it like total fucking bullshit? Who knows?,
"It’s a physical fun palace. It’s if you like it and she likes it, it’s all good. Uh, this guy – look at the fucking bird mask like it’s  .",
No.,
"Greg. It’s not 1997. It’s not this and it’s not that. Don’t be so binary, Mr Betamax.",
It’s basically a collective of hot people – and Connor. At a party. With a monkey dressed as an astronaut. It’s whatever you want it to be. It’s a fucking – sandpit for emergent behaviors.,
Sure. Maybe we could find you a Bloomberg terminal to stick your cock in?,
"See, Tom? How about a little faith?",
Molly. Happy pills. Con man. C’mon. No?,
Connor. Do not do any more of these.,
Wait. What’s going on …? Dude. Are you pitching? Did you just pitch?,
Don’t stop. I want to hear the big pitch. I might invest.,
To him? The enemy? Dude? He’s doing apps now. Did he say? He has this dry-cleaning one. It’s going to revolutionize the way we get grease spots out of ‘chinos’.,
"Sandy, could we maybe get a moment in private? Because I’d like to talk to you about how attached you’re feeling to your fifty failing local TV stations?",
"I’m good thanks, Kendall.",
Haha. No.,
"Look I know you and my dad are deeply and happily in hate and have been for many years – but I need you to know, I’m my own thing. And I’m fully authorized to negotiate on Logan’s behalf.",
I’m actually overseeing telecoms.,
"You’ll have to excuse my brother, he’s making some adjustments right now and he’s a little ‘off-center’.",
You see this? How he talks to me?,
You know he used to lock me in a cage?,
Back when we were younger. True story. What? You pretending you don’t remember the Dog Pound?,
"It was a game, I had to climb into the big Alsatian cage in the kitchen and wait for someone to come collect me.",
"Might be three minutes, might be the whole afternoon. Four years old. Eating dog food from a cold tin bowl.",
"Pissed myself in there once. He just gave me some newssheet and told me to mop it up. I know, right? They should make a fucking movie about this shit.",
What?,
"Oh, I can’t— I can say what I want.",
You want me to pretend none of it happened?,
So none of that happened? The Dog Pound?,
There was a bowl and it was filled with chow and I had to stay in there until it was finished.,
I enjoyed being in a cage for three hours with a leash around my neck. Sure.,
"Hey Con, can I ask you something?",
Dude? That’s the drugs talking.,
"Trust me, it’s the drugs.",
"For fuck’s sake, you’re not in love, man.",
"Sure. On your Mormon sex ranch. Look, do you remember anything about the Dog Pound from growing up?",
So he did? He used to lock me in a cage?,
Right? What a bastard.,
What?,
Okay. So I ‘asked’ to eat dog food?,
"Bullshit. Kendall locked me in a cage, I went all fucking weird, started pissing the bed and that’s why Dad sent me away to St Andrew’s.",
You’re full of shit.,
What is it with you and him? You’ve been up his ass all day. Are you trying to fuck him?,
Make sure what?,
"Is something going on, Greg? Because I can see inside your brain. And if anything’s obscured. I’ll pull your fingers off.",
Yes.,
Absolutely not.,
Tom. Don’t rationalize. You get off and you eat the shame for dessert. Wait. Her? This one?,
My god. Holy shit. Dad would go absolutely nuts for her. You should do it.,
Man. I’d be all over her. I’d like— I’d fucking – . Oh yeah.,
So is now a good time to sit down with the old geezer?,
So when can I talk to him? Because I would love to secure something to take home?,
"You know what – fuck you. I’m not your little pet that you get to kick around. You think I can’t make life difficult for you? Word in the right ear, I can be your migraine, motherfucker. I came here to talk to the old man. On your word. So make it happen.",
"—and I’d be the pointman on this, you wouldn’t even have to deal direct with my dad. So if we can find a price— But there’s potential?",
"I’m excited. This is pure upside, for both of us. —",
Congratulations. I hear you swallowed your own load.,
Woof woof.,
"Er – hey, Shiv, listen, good news. I got my lump hammer out and broke some shin bones and I got the launch moved. It’s on. We can throw it large at the party?",
My satellite launch. I thought it would be cool – and Tom said—,
Tom?,
"C’mon, don’t be a fucking witch about this?",
"Well, yes. Yes it fucking does, it’s kind of the whole fucking thing for me. Hey? Hey. Tabs? Tabitha? No don’t – don’t. I was sharp. Don’t go.",
Because. Because – you’re great for me.,
"I’m sorry, okay? It’s just it’s not a rocket. It’s a flag.",
It’s a trumpet. It’s a huge fiery trumpet.,
I was gonna meme-jack it to announce a personal rebrand. But now everything’s fucked. Forever.,
Dad’s coming? Is it about the launch? Is he concerned?,
I guess technically I should take a swing at you?,
"So, you gonna calm your shit-talk down, or do we have to ramp up?",
You got a laptop? You seen the shit out there? We’re the fucking good guys now.,
"Join in, bro, by the way, feel free. Shiv? Your guy here is shit-talking our company.",
Uh-huh. Nice. Very nice. —,
"Okay, what was all that, cocksucker?",
Fuck you. Did he mention the launch? He knows I’ve accelerated? —,
Well thank you. I met her at a sex party where she was giving the groom a blowjob.,
Excuse me?,
She says she’s being impish.,
"You know, you’re fucking great.",
"You’re not a headfuck, or a bitch or a leech.",
"Seriously. You’re a unicorn. You came over here. I mean how long have we known each other? And you haven’t got your meat hooks in at all, you never once asked to stay over or how it works with my dad or the trust or what my stake is, you know?",
"I tell you what, Tabs, I’m like stepping up, grown-up shit.",
What if I was prepared to marry you?,
"Shiv’s getting married, Kendall got married.",
Why?,
Why?,
Yeah we do.,
Oh come on. We do! We’ve been busy.,
Well there’s no need to be disgusting.,
"Tabs, please, I’ve asked you not to talk about—",
"No. No. It’s just – Tom. Look, I can’t get into all this. Do you want to get married or not?",
KENDALL Hey!,
I thought you were going to tell him?,
Do you want me to get him? I told Willa?,
I thought this was for old times’.,
Oh c’mon. I’m gonna be stoned out of my gourd!,
"So. Listen. Guys. Look. I’ve got something I need to tell you. I went to Mom’s. And she got me to sort through some of her old papers. And – Shiv, you’re adopted. And Kendall you’re adopted. And Connor’s adopted. So I think that means everything comes to me and you can all fuck off?",
"No, it’s nice. Congratulations.",
He doesn’t know what he’s saying he’s so fucking high.,
What is this?,
No way. That is so gay.,
"Okay come on, bring it in.",
"If either of you try to fuck me, I will hit you.",
That’s big.,
"Seriously. That’s big of you. It must hurt, being outside, seeing me do big shit? Winning the game.",
"I hope you’re okay outside, man.",
"Yeah and she seems to loathe me, which I obviously find incredibly appealing.",
Um—,
"Side effects may include: diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath, anal seepage, sexual dysfunction, blindness and death.",
"Con. Where you been, man?",
This was the place we came. We always came here.,
"Um, dude, I’d like Tabs in this one, okay?",
Uh-huh. Yes. I’m pretty into her. And it might be nice.,
"It’s just what, Tom?",
Is it him? You don’t want a rocket launch cos of him? Would it help if it was a rocket full of – Muslim – granola?,
‘Oh I’m so adult and important because I work for a man with glasses.’ Is he a Jew by the way?,
"What? It’s just a simple, friendly, slightly racist question. You used to be fun. When did you become one of them, Shiv?",
The fucking dancey bullshit people.,
"The n-word, the b-word, the c-word. The world isn’t a fucking nursery school. And people don’t like being taught.",
Excuse me. I actually have to go watch a satellite launch in Japan that I’m actually in charge of? That I reorganized for you. But you’re too fucking carbon neutral to enjoy.,
Ugh huh?,
"Uh-huh, thanks for looking after us!",
I’m sorry? What?,
"Oh, great. It went great.",
Could you perhaps fetch me a stronger beverage? Hi. Yes? Can I help?,
"Well that’s weird, because I haven’t had any?",
It blew up?,
Okay. Wow. They should have told me. That’s – naughty. And how bad is it? Is it bad?,
And are— People are there people who are – from the launch site?,
Does Dad know?,
No. Will you tell him?,
"Right. So, can they deal? Out there can I— I mean, this is a little detail in my world, Gerri. Not to be horrible?",
I was somewhat aware of the endeavor.,
Uh-huh. Because I did put on quite a lot of pressure to accelerate the launch even though there were concerns.,
Yes I did.,
I thought it would be nice. For it to happen on Shiv’s wedding day. Like fireworks? Big fireworks.,
"I’m just telling you because I sent quite a lot of emails and I – you know— There’s no use hiding that because— I mean I’m just going to say, that’s for you as general counsel to know. So you can protect me.",
"Ladies and gentlemen. I give you. The bride and groom! — So. Yes. It’s me. I am the best man. And truly, I am the best man. No disrespect to Tom’s oldest friends, I’m just superior to them. I’d like to welcome Tom to the family. I don’t feel like I’m losing a sister, more that I’m gaining another, uglier, more ladylike sister. What can I tell you about Tom? Very little, nothing really sticks. He was born and grew up, in – um America. The middle. In an Applebees. I should imagine. I’ve never asked. His parents are here. I’d point them out but they’re basically nobodies. What? Folks, I don’t want to be mean – it’s what a best man’s speech is. They’re actually incredibly lovely people. Just poor and uninteresting. I’m kidding! But I imagine what you really want to know is what went on at the bachelor party? Yeah nothing he was well behaved! Although he did get a blow job. I’m kidding! No. I’m not. I am. Am I? No I am. I’m being horrible. It’s the job. —",
"You’re a real piece of work, you know that? You act like you’re a fucking – guy, a decent guy, but seriously?",
Boo-hoo. Boo-fucking-hoo.,
Yeah I have a question. What the fuck in the name of all the fuck in the universe do you think you’re doing?,
"By fucking us, forever?",
"Well no, because for one thing, our inheritance is all in stock so after this, if Dad goes loco – and pisses it all away, nothing.",
This isn’t about a dress.,
"We don’t know. But it will be fine. And, dude, were you kidding, about the presidential thing?",
Because I think it’d be a disaster.,
"Right. I mean, what would you even – want to do.",
Which are?,
"Excuse me, Harry Potter?",
Cuck-oo.,
"Well, tell me about it.",
Did you hear yet?,
Japan? How many dead?,
None? None at all?,
Are you kidding? It’s just an arm? A couple of fucking thumbs?,
Are you kidding? Jesus. We’re not going to ruin a party over a couple of fucking thumbs!,
"Okay, see? I’m making us money!",
"Hey, Tom, guess who didn’t kill anyone? But only maybe lost a coupla thumbs?",
This guy!,
"Tabs. It’s alright, it’s okay, nobody died!",
Yeah I kinda always wondered if I was a psychopath but apparently not. I’m actually relieved. We have to celebrate!,
Uh-huh.,
"‘It was fine’? She whispered, exhausted from their lovemaking. What every man longs to hear.",
Two stars.,
Yeah?,
The thing is. I  do anything? I have the money? It’s just figuring out what.,
"I went to college, but I wasn’t really paying attention.",
"I just wish I knew everything, about something. One thing, to build on. Then I could just – bang – fuck them all!",
What?,
"Yeah? I mean, what’s the play?",
"Dad? Dad? You want me to ride with you, talk things through?",
I dunno. I mean that’s a question I often ask myself.,
"Yeah, people are suddenly super-curious about their liability. D&O insurance. And whose names are on those papers?",
Hey. He’ll have a plan.,
This? It’s Kirsty-May Fuck You.,
We have a fucking boat.,
So. Look. What are you actually thinking here?,
"Yeah, what are you thinking?",
In terms of – the fucking – situation?,
"Oh, right, like I’m going to tell you what I’m thinking.",
Fuck you.,
No sure of course.,
Yeah?,
Fuck you. You are? Really?,
"I dunno, yeah, I guess. Fuck. I’m trying to get it in proportion. But I guess, I was thinking: ‘Should I be thinking, is he toast?’",
"By George, I think he’s on to something!",
Fuck you. What are they saying?,
"Oh Jesus. Karl?  takes a moral stand? Guess what, Karl might have found his moral compass.",
"Come on, man?",
What’s that?,
"Well – obviously not, Dad.",
Kendall’s mentally ill. He’s insane.,
"Well, unless we don’t?",
"Pull up the drawbridge. It’s politically motivated, ‘Come get us, motherfuckers.’ And we get— shredding.  we even need to.",
"Our story is: ‘It’s sad he’s exploiting these poor women. You were grooming him for the top. But guess what? He’s a pathetic junkie and he blew up. He’s a bitter fuck-up who needs psychiatric help. And of course you’re the big baddie, so everyone’s jumped on board.’",
"Fakes. Stolen. If they even exist. Are you worried about the papers? Go after him for theft of corporate property. It’s not nice to say about your son – but maybe you chop him into a million pieces and throw him in the Hudson? Destroy Kendall, it falls apart.",
"Well, everything’s high-risk, if you’re a pussy?",
"You’re looking too small. We’ll do a dance – the DOJ will lean on us, Waystar resists … we bide our time until the election. ATN anointy-nointy the Raisin for a second term? New attorney general. By then it’s all getting stale, Kendall will self-destruct because that’s his favorite. It all fades the fuck away. ‘Politicize it, don’t criticize it.’",
"We cooperate, outsiders come in. We lose control of the situation. ‘Fuck you’ is high-risk, but it’s high reward?",
"I mean, fuck. Maybe you call up the attorney general right now?",
"If he was to call up the AG and shout at him, could we find out if that would be okay?",
We might want to drug-test the pilots. He doesn’t like the look of the aircrew.,
"‘Bahrain, Bosnia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Maldives, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Vatican’?",
They’re all made up? They’re all lands with dragons?,
Oh. Okay. Fuck.,
It’s fine. Shut up.,
Might just be for lunch?,
I still like saying fuck ’em and killing my brother. It just feels so right.,
Interesting call?,
"Oh ‘just bullshit’? Right. So boring. I hate boring shit, don’t you?",
"I just hate boring phone calls about bullshit. They’re so boring, aren’t they, Shiv? Yeah because Gerri just heard from Frank? Dad’s live-picking a new CEO.",
‘Oh okay’. Tom didn’t mention that?,
Fuck you!,
"Wanna make it interesting, put a little money on the table?",
Dad. Can I speak for one moment?,
"Look, it’s already getting out what you’re thinking about so can I just throw a couple of things in the – old lobster pot?",
I think it should be me.,
"It’s my time. I think I can do it, I want it and I think I can. So. LOGAN / ROMAN Okay— / But—",
What? You say?,
"Okay. Well I think it should be me. . If you don’t think I’m ready, okay, which I would understand and I’m not saying I agree, but you know, a couple of years under the wing of an older, hen, could, you know, see me crack out of the old egg? So can I just say, I know you’ve been sweet on Shiv, and I love her, like a brother, haha, but I just don’t think this is the time. You know? All bitterness aside, I do wonder if it isn’t Gerri time. Let the, stone-cold bitch do it? She’s tough, she’s got the good chromosomes. So, if it ain’t Romey time maybe it’s croney time, right?",
I hope I haven’t offended?,
Have you made a decision?,
"Okay. Well. I’d love it but you know, I understand. But I do want it. Okay? But, you know. No hard feelings. So. Listen, I’m gabbling. I love you.",
What? Oh fuck! Fuck! Go on.,
You fucking bitch.,
And he didn’t say – about CEO?,
Any vibes?,
‘On what’? The whole will-my-dad-go-to-jail situation? Who’s climbing Mount Olympus to be the new Dr Zeus? You know I put in a word for you.,
"What’s going to happen, you think?",
Fascinating. You’re really letting me in here. Look at us here. Waiting. So fucking – hot.,
Obviously – there is that bed through there? Wanna give it a go? Jigga-jigga? Hubba-bubba?,
"That was mostly over. There’s deniability, Frank thinks. We essentially didn’t even know. It’s all on the little guys – and Mo.",
"I’d lay you badly, but I’d lay you gladly?",
"Just once though? ‘Give us a try won’t ya, Her Majesty, I’m ever so eager!’",
"You must be curious though? Young fighter, in his prime, technically raw, but hungry.",
"We’re going to sit here for an hour, Gerri. It’s essentially irrelevant whether we do it or not? No one will ever know.",
So?,
You’re kidding.,
Are you kidding?,
It’s actually you?,
"Okay? Shit a pony, so, what, you’re the boss of me?",
"Well, congratulations … You fucking – bitch.",
"You know, I think I probably swung that for you, you know that?",
"I don’t know where she is, Dad.",
"Heading for a shit, a shave and a shower.",
"You want me to go talk to him, to Ken?",
"Uh-huh. Well, thank you.",
Awww.,
That’s so cute. How they doing? You got pictures?,
"Okay, good for you to let me know sensitive areas. You know me, I’ll be very respectful. So this is it? It’s happening. The fucking – odor prevails. The gas also rises.",
"No. I’m proud. Who would have thought it? ‘The nothing woman of Idaho’. The Cleaning Woman. The Potato State. Look at you smiling, it’s so pathetic, it’s heartbreaking.",
"Are you happy? You must be happy, right? Are you physically happy, Gerri? It’s hard to tell.",
"And I wanted to check, are you concerned about – this at all?",
I just hope you’re not anxious that you’ve – chained yourself to a fire hydrant that spews out cultural insensitivity and sperms?,
Right?,
You mean I sometimes ‘surf the web’.,
"Look, I’m thinking: You should put together an executive committee to guide things in this interregnum.",
"Yeah but big calls, you dip everyone’s hands in blood. But you and me run it to fuck?",
Uh-huh. Likey likey. That’s good.,
Yeah.,
"Okay? ‘The rockstar and the – the – the molewoman’. It’s happening, baby.",
"Okay! Well now, looky-looky here! Who’s this then, ah?",
Well fuck me. I wondered— But— Okay!,
How is he? He is wondering where the fuck you are. Why aren’t you picking up?,
"Oh sure, . None at all.",
"He’s fine. I guess. Gerri’s looking at how it works to buy a private island in the Philippines. Regular stuff. So, what the fuck is your game?",
I’m just here looking for you.,
"Okay, here he comes! The coward of the county!",
Yeah great. Just a great few days all round. How about you?,
"Uh-huh. Interesting. Really interesting. I mean I guess to hear what you’re really thinking, I’ll have to wait for you to call a – you know – a fucking national press conference – and you’ll be like ‘No! I  I was fine but  I  fine and Roman’s a dick and he made me feel bad because he didn’t even bring anything from the airport! So I’m taking this whole thing down!!’ I actually got you some of the Danish cinnamon things, from wherever. I think you like them, so far as I recall.",
Bleurgh. Whatever. I don’t know.,
I am literally only here to spy on her.,
"What’s with all the humans, dude?",
That was spontaneous?,
"Oh, okay, so you spoke to a lawyer?",
"Right a spontaneous, heartfelt outpouring of thoroughly lawyered emotion?",
On Dad’s behalf.,
Who?,
"Right, I thought I heard a clown car pull up.",
Great and will we all be wearing costumes that you’ve designed?,
Don’t he use that tongue prettier than a twenty-dollar whore?,
"What you mean ? This multi-ethnic, transgender alliance of twentysomething dreamers we have right here?",
Is it something to do with grapefruit?,
"Can you pass me that bong, dude? He’s the wisest cat in the whole dorm!",
Yeah there’s just something about betraying our father that doesn’t sit well?,
Hmm. Impressively wordified linguafication.,
"If he hadn’t done it, someone else would have made the same dollar doing the same shit.",
"I’m just going to say, right out, I’m a spy, I’m going to go right back and tell him everything. I’m with Dad. Fuck you.",
Gerri’s a good choice.,
What?,
I was simply saying—,
"Fuck off, Siobhan.",
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Bitch.,
What? I went to the bathroom. I don’t give a fuck. You whore.,
"Well, no I didn’t know. No.",
"I knew, I knew that they had— But I didn’t know— I didn’t – I really didn’t.",
What did we know?,
So what?,
Just – hear him out and report. Right?,
"Well, I don’t know about that?",
I’m not sure I want to speculate.,
Yeah?,
Then why are you making fucky eyes at me?,
"Well, yeah you are.",
"Well, yeah you were. It’s not necessarily even true, Shiv. Dad’s fucking Moby Dick. He could take us all down even with his back bristling with harpoons.",
I mean what do you think?,
"I don’t think Dad would go anyway, do you, Con?",
No. Sure. I just don’t think he has ever failed. Or ever will.,
I don’t know. Maybe.,
It’s his board.,
"I guess, my only other concern, is, if it might actually kill him?",
Busy fucking bee.,
"And what’s the shape of this fucking, new reality, with us leapfrogging Amazon?",
"Uh-huh, of course.",
Uh-huh?,
"Oh,  oversee us?",
You’d do that?! You are one !,
"A ‘stretch’ – him? It’s a fucking, scrotum across a timpani drum.",
"Whoa, Nelly!",
"I just spoke to the market, that’s exactly what the market thinks.",
Well I do actually need to make some calls. So?,
I’m at Ken’s and he wants us to join up with him and take down Dad.,
"So yeah, nightmare for you if it happens. But, put that aside – which you obviously can’t. But if I do it. What happens?",
Right. And who takes over? Kendall – or me? Or Shiv?,
Uh-huh. But obviously I can’t trust you?,
I mean your advice is so compromised as to be worthless. But what’s your advice?,
"Don’t threaten me, Gerri. I don’t have the time to jerk off.",
I’m like ninety-eight percent sure they won’t be poisoned.,
"Well, no I’d say those are relevant donuts.",
"You love this don’t you, this is your dream?",
"Sorry, bro.",
A number of reasons.,
I have made a decision to stick with Dad.,
I think everything teaches us that.,
"Hey, Pop.",
Who? The one who matters? Yeah. I’m with her.,
"Nah. No. She was trying to get to Kendall, to push him off course.",
"She was dark cos she was all-in on trying to get to him, trying to talk him round. To like burn the papers. But she couldn’t change his mind. He’s gone bananas …",
Oh yeah. Yeah. She’s solid.,
What for?,
"I just told the truth, right?",
I did not do any positioning! I did the fucking business.,
Hey. El Presidente. How’s your headspace? Are you happy in it?,
"Hey. Dad, how’s your headspace?",
Well that seems like a grown-up solution that keeps everyone happy?,
Now who’s planting a flag?,
"I think it was just one of your mega-turds, Frank. But I guess someone wants to turn that into Silkwood?",
‘We get it’. A bit like those ladies on the cruise ships got it?,
Did you see him tagging their accounts on Twitter? I’m so embarrassed.,
Still works. It does work.,
"Fine fuck you I’ll go out and say I love Dad, sure. Why not? I do. So. Fuck you.",
Uh-huh. Very confident. Massive optimism.,
Tell me precisely every single word they are going to ask.,
Nope. Next question.,
"Mmmmm, no. Not doing that.",
So far these are very bad.,
Are you fucking kidding me?,
"I mean, I got one in the bank. ‘Fly-fishing in Montana’. If you want me to wheel that out?",
Wah-wah. Did they write their questions in crayon?,
Fuck no. This one would make his head explode.,
Can we please find out who asked this one?,
Sure but this is just rude. It’s not really a question. It has a huge agenda. I don’t think people should be thinking things like this who work here.,
Can we get more questions? Like less – questiony? Because these are horrible questions.,
Could we discourage him with a taser shot directly into his peni or scrummage sacking?,
I don’t see him yet? With his stupid walk.,
Trying to kiss or nibble Tom.,
Not staying?,
"Nice. Keep out of the – bloodbath? The fucking, jacuzzi of gore.",
"Uh-huh just been you know, on TV waxing lyrical about me and Dad, out murdering trout and singing sea shanties round the old marshmallow hole.",
"Oh, man. This is … quite a rich brew.",
Urrgghh …,
"It’s, really pretty. It’s kind of—",
It is very very horrible.,
"Mmmmmmm. Ahhhh. Gurrrr. I mean, sure, fuck him. But this is out there forever?",
Did Dad ask for us all to do this?,
"Yeah look, I’m sorry, but I already gave at the office. I’m not signing this.",
Because it makes me feel unwell and I don’t want to. And he taught me how to aim into the toilet.,
Uh-huh then take me to reason court and sue me.,
Yeah but I try to keep it down to like six a day. And I’m not sure this is in my best interests.,
Same. I’m feeling brutally unsucked right now.,
"Me? Just running some numbers with Gerri. On, you know, the fucking— Getting the distribution deals with these fucking— It’s murder.",
Uh-huh. And sorry about the – the letter or whatever. I just—,
No it was just—,
"Well, you know?",
Right. We don’t have to dissect it.,
"Ha, yeah.",
Mmm. Conference call jokes are the best jokes.,
The chiseling little fuck—,
"Wow, thanks for the namecheck, Siobhan.",
"Once again, great joke, Ken.",
"Amazing, Mrs Churchill. Hey, Dad? One thing. Will you stay on?",
"Um, is it just us? Hello? Yeah, I’ve been digging around and I’ve got something, on Ken, good leverage. Shrink his halo into a cock ring. I’m just keen that I do my share, of the fuckery, you know? After the letter and whatnot?",
"Okay, can we strategize? Because I’ve got potential gold and I need your read on how to deploy.",
What I can’t take my shoes off?,
"And I can’t masturbate at a time and place of my choosing? This is a police state you’re building, Gerri.",
"Listen, here’s the thing – I’ve found tattoo-man.",
"Yup. Funny story. Like, fifteen years ago, Kendall’s bachelor party, New Orleans. We did an ironic bar crawl on Bourbon Street and got chatting to a friendly hobo and there was some talk of various disgusting endeavors – ‘would the hobo eat a deep-fried deck shoe?’ – before we finally settled on a rather ‘indecent proposal’, which was to get the homeless man to have Kendall’s name tattooed on his forehead.",
"Yeah, we got Kendall’s initials tattooed on a rando.",
"I know. Horrible right? We a hobo. Shameful. So anyway, I told Sam who told the black-ops team.",
It was surprisingly difficult considering we tattooed a name on him. I mean we basically filed him for later.,
On Kendall? Woke-ahontas? Using a poor’s forehead as a Post-it? ‘Need milk’. ‘Take down Dad’.,
"So. Let’s talk it out over lunch. Tactics, TikToks and dick pics?",
A date? Excuse me. You have a ‘date’—?,
A date at . Fuck off—? With who? Montgomery Clift? The Ghost of Christmas Past?,
"Well, ‘Laurie’. My god. Well he sounds fucking cool. Laurie. You want Laurie to  you, in the parking lot?",
"No I get it. You’re drawing a line? Or what, Laurie might knock my jolly old block off, if he can find his sword stick and fire up his motorized bath chair?",
"Yeah—? Fucking man. This is nuts. Keep a straight face, okay? Is this the dirt from the dirtmen?",
"Oh sure. We should all be upstanding for the guy with my brother’s name tattooed on his head. Mm. Looks like Ken’s stopped eating again? Wonder if he’ll go full anno? Two days – no food. Just sports gloop and apples? Hey. Hey, man.",
How. How you doing? You look good.,
"Right sure. Me too. I’m kidding. But, yeah thanks for being here. Thanks.",
"Right, yeah. Good to catch up. ‘It’s been too long.’ ‘You never call,’ et cetera. Hahaha. Hugo?",
"I’m sorry, and I don’t want to be a dick, but I’m looking, and I’ll just say, you are the guy, right, is it there?",
"I mean that’s a shame, you had something there and it was really working for you. Can I? I mean you can kind of see it? Right?",
"Crazy idea, never happen in a million years – you wouldn’t consider having it – done again, would you? Or a recreation in pen for photos?",
"Right, and without wishing to make this too transactional – how much?? For the photos?",
Oh sure. There must be a number though …,
But maybe they wouldn’t see them if you could afford to send them to a finishing school in Switzerland?,
"I found the guy we tattooed. Justin Albescu. I’m working on photos. I think we got him. I think it really hurts him, Dad.",
Hey. How things looking?,
How was the date? You fuck him or just tug him off between courses?,
"Oh my god you did – you tugged him off under the table, you absolute monster! Tell me, did you wear your work glasses or your whore glasses —?",
Gerri – are you – flirting with me?,
"It was so fucking funny, Gerri. I mean, I wanted to cry and be sick too.",
I’m giving them to Dad. He wants to get them out right away.,
This is a magic bullet. Dad will give me my bedtime bath.,
Ooooh. Gerri – you – care?,
"I hear you tried to kill Dad again, fatty.",
That’s not what we’re hearing. We’re hearing you took an old man out to die in the sun.,
"You tried to assassinate our dad with the sun. Do you have a fetish for killing Dad? Like, ‘just the tip’ but for killing Dad.",
"Well, no he’s out.",
"Frank just got off the phone. Dad’s freakout gave him the shits. Weak leadership, fractured at the top. You let him fucking shrivel, he saw. He has quote, ‘zero faith in the post-Dad leadership’. So go eat a donut, ya jowly fuck. We’re gonna lose the company at the shareholder meet all because you wouldn’t give our dad a timely fucking Evian. Goodnight! Episode Five",
How you feeling?,
"I guess, even on your way to the chair you keep thinking, ‘It won’t happen to little old me.’",
"Okay, here they are! Pump and Dump the corporate clowns.",
Great. ‘Voting’. Let’s throw it open to the fucking retired janitors of Idaho.,
"Those pussies won’t bail once they hear God speak, right?",
"The cavalry has arrived! So, Con, the news is – tomorrow we’re all gonna try to get jobs in the same branch of Target.",
"Okay here he comes! The Big Beast. Ready to kick ass, with his big, ass-kicking shoe.",
They have thoughts? What kind of thoughts?,
Fucking A!,
Does Sandy really have syphilis? What if he’s covered in sores? What if he takes his dick off and waves it around and screams ‘Yahtzee’?,
This is good. More pressure on the Raisin. If he can understand what’s going on.,
"I think Gerri won, Shiv, but nice try.",
"Uh-huh. So, how bad is he? Is it true they’re building him a mechanical dick out of Legos?",
"And, no offense, I have to ask, he is definitely fully aware of everything that is at stake and just he is a full – person – here?",
I mean I’m just going to say it right out since there’s an eighty- five-billion-dollar baby on the table here – Sandy – how do we know he’s not your meat puppet?,
"With all due respect, Ger, get bent.",
What—? No. I don’t know. Why the fuck you asking me?,
Are we good?,
About trying to fuck me over to consolidate your position?,
"Throwing me overboard to drown? You picked your prince, Gerri. Don’t fuck it up now.",
"Hey, hey, hey! Dad, you would have loved it. Sandy had a guy draining his spit so he didn’t choke.",
The PJs? No.,
"Well, duh. Look, no. They’re trying to humiliate him.",
Bullshit. Nah. First they came for the PJs and I said nothing. Then they came for our outsized compensation payments – you know? They’ll back down. They won’t blow it up over this. Dad? What do you say?,
Yes. He’s a fucking – badass. He’s gambling the company cos he’s a fucking baller.,
"Shiv, he said no deal.",
"If we win without a deal, it’s all upside.",
It’s fucking classic Dad.,
He’s trusted his gut before and it’s always worked out.,
He fucking always knows something. He’s six moves ahead.,
Tell her he’d have more time if we weren’t fighting the DOJ.,
"Seriously? Is that—? That’s not bad though, right?",
Should we give him a cranberry juice and ask him again?,
Well we don’t know. What about the phone call he took? The decision might have been a good decision. We don’t know when he went piss-mad?,
Oh do you? The fucking Hercule Poirot of piss here.,
"Yeah, great idea. Dad loves being overruled.",
‘Can he do the speech?’ The piss-mad demented King of England?,
"Fine, have Colin take it out.",
"It’s an imaginary cat, now fuck off.",
Delusional! A delusional man is leaving the room right now!,
But he’ll definitely be okay?,
Let’s take it easy. You wanna give him the fucking Tabasco suppository?,
The main thing is that we look after him.,
Shiv? We’re not going to make the piss-mad bear dance with cattle prods? We need to look after him.,
Well no because Dad said—,
"Go on, go and fuck it up, moron.",
Could we tell him to fuck off. By all accounts he won’t remember by tomorrow?,
Well he can’t talk to Dad. He’s still grieving the invisible cat.,
Gimme.,
He’s a prick with a button. —,
Okay. Well. I’ll relay that. You’re not running again and you hope we’re happy?,
"And I mean this is decided? Because I think, whatever our – our – minor differences we’d urge you, to – to and not to stand aside right now? Uh-huh? But, no I’ll be the messenger boy, happy to be that— I just, I think our position would be – speaking for my father here, you know good friends can be tough in their constructive criticism but, we would say you know and I’ve seen, you’re a really, a significant historical figure with so much more to give, and the whole – family at ATN would rally round— Well, it’s been a privilege to have this opportunity to— Okay then. Well, I hear you. All the best and— Yeah, so, he wanted us to know he’s quitting. He’s got a ‘minor neurological issue’ that the media, starting with us, have blown out of all proportion and he doesn’t want to put his family through blah blah, fuck Dad, fuck me and Ravenhead, fuck ATN and good luck getting the kind of access he’s granted with whoever is the next president. Which, if it’s left up to him, could be a chicken.",
"I mean it’s nice to know we can – like – mold the whole American Republic project and all, but— —",
"I mean, Dad is going to walk out of there at some point …",
We’re good. We’re good. No vote. Hold the voting.,
Stop him. Tase him!,
I’m gonna miss the big boot. At least we could hear him coming.,
Clearly fucking.,
Showing memes to a young menial? Tale as old as time.,
I heard he’s still really into blowjobs. That’s his thing.,
"Think that’s been around for a while, Pop, but yeah, well played, the internet.",
"Oh yeah, we’re all slaves on the Zuck plantation. Picking digital cotton for the likes. I can hit it.",
Boohoo. It’s not our fault the president’s brain couldn’t thunk good no more.,
"Heh. Lil Ms Libtard, how you like spelunking in the elephant’s asshole?",
Wait till the weekend’s over. We’re gonna get our white cis-male stank all over you.,
"Well no, actually, Shiv, the Maniacs are just taking charge.",
"‘The Maniacs’ are actually quite boring, when you look into it.",
Speaking of maniacs.Captain Kook from the SS .,
Yay. The Republic.,
Here? Just a nice political conference of like-minded donors and intellectuals.,
No sure. But really it is.,
"Yeah, sorry about that.",
Dave the steady old plow horse.,
"But at some point you do? I mean eventually you do. Just before you win? MICHELLE-ANNE You don’t want to be the hare, you want to be the tortoise.",
"Hard shell, stubby legs. Exciting.",
"I mean, between us, I think his brain was shot. So it had to come out. You hear some whackadoo stuff.",
"Oh yeah. Apparently heads of state would be coming in to the O and everyone would be like, ‘Has he got the old hot-dog stand open?’ Like check he was zipped up?",
Wanted to use the ding-a-ling like it was a pen. Tried to veto bills with it.,
"Some of it is rumors I’m sure. But yeah we had a duty to report it, even if it hurt our interests overall because we loved the guy.",
It’s like he’s a cartoon bear and there’s always a picnic hamper nearby.,
"Umm, I don’t rightly know?",
Uh-huh. For what? What have I done now?,
"Um, no. Nope? She’s in a relationship with a canoe-shaped gentleman named Rory.",
"Uh-huh? Well, this is— Uh-huh. Well, yeah, this seems to be— Okay well, you know how it is, Glyn. Families! Can you forward this to me?",
"To my mom’s wedding? Yeah I think that’s okay, Glyn. Hey. So, you know about this, you withholding bitch?",
Glyn the Brexit pervert sent this to me. Mom’s getting married. To ‘Peter Munion’.,
"I don’t know. I think I remember, is he one of those guys—? A Sunday-lunch man?",
What the fuck. You call her!,
That’s true actually. Why doesn’t Mom like you? We should call her and find out.,
"Hey, bro. I’m here with Shiv. Just wanted to let you know … New dad just dropped.",
"Mom’s getting remarried, dingus.",
Of course he didn’t know. Ken bores the shit out of Mom.,
"Look, we just wanted to let you know Mom still doesn’t love you, Ken, bye!",
"Oh okay. Hey, it’s the ghost pepper. The spicy new flavor. —",
"Me, I always found it hard to care about politics.",
"I’ve seen your poll numbers. You’re dark-horsin’ it. People buying your whole thing, huh?",
Now we’re talking!,
But with beatings?,
I like this. Just a couple of cool guys having disgusting fun.,
What’s that?,
"Oh, yeah, no. He’s not— That’s not going to happen.",
"Okay, so. Mom says it’s all fine. She is getting remarried, but we’re not to get it out of proportion or cook it up into a whole big thing. It isn’t  but he makes her laugh, he is a little bit awful and vulgar and he wants a huge social wedding to show off in Tuscany and she’s sorry for not telling us but she couldn’t because Rory doesn’t know yet and he might kill himself and he can’t because he’s building her a new chicken coop but he’s got the black dog and it wouldn’t be fair right now. It’s dumb but I guess it kind of makes sense.",
"What? No, Shiv, I am not sad. I don’t give a hoot.",
"No, Shiv, because I’m not eight years old.",
Sick burn.,
You recognize him? The jelly-boned low-T chinless fuck.,
"No. We should stop it, right?",
"Get over it? It just happened. Our mother is getting married to some dickhead crooked-tooth turnip man. What is wrong is how little you care, you frozen bitch.",
"I – I kinda like Mencken but, you know, he’s been shitty, so if it was now I guess, Boyer. But can I note, I do not like Boyer. So. What?",
Oh Mrs Politics? How many big races did you win as a consultant?,
Then do we talk to Mencken and see if we can deal?,
‘Four score years and whatever my sister did bring forth from her bedroom a cup of milky sputum.’,
He’s just shifting the Overton window.,
"Stop Chicken-Littling us, Shiv. It just makes everyone want to take a nap.",
There you go again. So route one.,
You have a trophy husband and several fur coats. You’ll be fine.,
You do? Can I watch you jibe sometime? At some special jibing club?,
"Sure. You get to vote at the election, with the other folks.",
"Easy, Castro.",
"Shiv, can I just say I know we have our differences but you are just  for picking the brown man. Should we send you a particular medal for white women who like brown men?",
"Oooh oooh, I’m the good girl, I pretend to care about people, because no one ever cared about me!",
"Fine fuck you. Yes, I do. Yeah – Mum’s getting remarried.",
"No, Peter, Peter Munion?",
Yeah and she –  would – love it apparently if you came to their Tuscan wedding?,
"Quit butt-huffing Salgado, Shiv. We all agreed to pretend your political career was real, out of pity, but this actually matters.",
"Sure. I dunno. Yeah. I mean ? Crap-pants for president? Um. I guess. Sure. I dunno. They’re all fucking weirdos, I guess, so why not? No offense, Con.",
I mean is this serious? We’re talking about trying to make Connor president. Of the United States of America?,
"Sure. No, fine. Fine. I might call my dentist. He’s a possible?",
If she’s bringing in Soggy Salgado I want to see if we can tame Mencken. Okay?,
Fun shit before. Tripping the light fantastic on the grandpappy’s ballsacks.,
"I mean, sure. Whatever. Hardcore.",
"Nope. No. No dancing here. Not in Pappy’s bathroom. I guess the thing is. I’m just going to say it. Fascists are kind of cool, but not really you know, so is that a thing? A problem.",
Uh-huh? ‘H’? You know there was a very naughty boy called H who—,
You really are a Christian aren’t you?,
And who gets to – to join?,
"And in terms of this here. There’s a thing, right? I mean I get it, you’re 6G, we’re Betamax. But you need us, right? Our news, viewers. The almost-deads. Big slice of pie.",
This is going to be a shit show going into the convention. You need our push.,
Uh-huh?,
Me? I’m creeping on the come-up.,
"I’ve got plans for ATN. Sluice out the oatmeal, add some sriracha. No more ‘Dave Plain-Penis and here’s what the Dow did today’. I want to make it more like … you?",
"My vision? Um … Smash the system. Fresh faces. Poach a couple TikTok psychos. E-girls with guns and Juul pods. Get me some straight-shot blacks and Latinos. Brain science and strength training for the working-class coalition. No more pillows and bedpans, we’re strictly bone broth and dick pills. Deep- state conspiracy hour but with a fucking wink, funny. And it’s all kinda set for the star of the show: President Jeryd Mencken.",
My dad’s a Titan.,
He’s nice.,
"Look, Dad. We came to market to buy you a nice milk cow but we found ourselves a fucking T-Rex. Okay? He’s box office. The guy’s diesel. He’s good on camera. He’s fun. He’ll fight. Viewers will eat from his hand. No downside.",
Oh please.,
"Meh meh. If we don’t come to an accommodation, we get outflanked and we lose the ATN fucking dollar machine when we need cash to fight tech. Look. I guess Shiv wants her way, and I want my way, and Connor wants his way, so it’s even and you have to—",
"Your polling was off again, Shiv. Definitely fucking.",
We’re doing a photo.,
Okay. We got this. Right? This all makes sense? He has some binders on how to make an acquisition of GoJo work.,
"Well, kind of regret staying up all night with my assholes then?!",
"Well. Of course. I mean, I would say we can handle the human stuff without too much issue. That needn’t concern us, it comes naturally, to some of us— which is why I have focussed so much work on the integration benefits, and deal detail.",
Well the big picture is made from small details?,
And you going tonight?,
"I might have to go, just to see how bad it is.",
Fuck you. It’s pure rubbernecking.,
Or she’s about to give birth to Dad’s baby while we chant a Satanic mass?,
It’s fine.,
"Hi. Oh, okay? Champagne?",
"Okay, Boxcar Willie, what the fuck’s going on?",
Laurie?,
Just a number?,
"Amen to that! Top me up, wontcha?",
Uh-huh. Dad’s thinking.,
He knows everything.,
We kind of might need to court them a little though?,
Can we not at least …?,
Unless someone else makes a better offer first?,
We can  talk to him. He’ll be there tonight?,
I’ll reorganize my diary.,
This is even worse-slash-better than I’d imagined. What happened?,
Uh-huh? Horse didn’t want you to fuck it?,
Classic ranch action. Real cowboy.,
Sure. Go. I can do it.,
"Yeah, fuck off, I’m not doing that.",
Busy.,
It’s going great. It’s just when you get to know her she’s actually quite boring.,
"She’s fine, she’s just a bit boring is all. That’s all I’m saying.",
Yes. Loved the intimacy. Love people really getting to know me.,
"So, if we’ve just been born then— Okay? So this is … So I’m inserting myself into my mother’s vagina right now?",
"I’m repeatedly entering my own mother? That is, not right. That’s my mom’s cooch, so you know. And you’re implying it’s massive. I think you should tighten my mom’s vagina.",
Nothing says party like a stack of literature.,
"Ken, pumping out the anti-Dad propaganda.",
Probably standing in a corner monitoring his biometrics on his watch. Maybe let’s just say a quick hello to Ken??,
"Okay. Just to say, I am only here because I’ve heard it’s going to be a five-dimensional catastrophe and I want to see you crash and burn. Also, I’ve just farted. So yeah – happy birthday.",
"My god, it’s like you  old. It’s like hugging a leather satchel filled with human remains.",
"Cough syrup and space dust, shoved down the gullet on a bed of spoon.",
"Uh-huh. And tell me, did you get Mom’s permission, for the use of her—?",
Call me old fashioned – I just feel like you should ask before you construct a giant replica of someone’s vagina?,
Your dad.,
Any real friends?,
From Dad.,
"Um, I think it’s all your milk teeth and an iTunes gift card. No, I’m kidding. It’s nice. It’s a nice thing. We hope you’ll like it.",
"Well, everyone in this room is now thinking about me jacking off. So who’s the real winner?",
One percent? Congratulations.,
"Well, okay. Let’s go!",
Shiv? Please.,
"Sure, but maybe leave the talking to me?",
That’s funny because lately everything I touch turns to gold and everything you touch withers and dies.,
Okay? A forty-year-old man rebuilding his childhood treehouse should instantly go on the sex offender registry.,
Um? The ranch? Montana? Is it?,
"Sure, man, I’m a walking rainbow band.",
"Yeah hey, Ken. May we please step inside your mental disorder?",
Yeah we’re here to do body shots off McCartney. Can we come on in?,
Why?,
"‘Colossal dick-cheese’? All lowercase? C’mon, fatty. Heave-ho.",
"Ken, don’t be a fucking moron.",
You’re actually not going to let us in?,
"Okay, so what? We just wanna talk to him. What’s the difference?",
LET US THE FUCK IN.,
Who’s that?,
Unbelievable. I genuinely hope his kidneys fail.,
"What? That’s nothing. Just a little move, to ease him out of the holding company.",
"Well, he can only sell to family, right, and yeah I think Dad put me on there. It’s housekeeping.",
"It’s a name on a piece of paper, Shiv.",
"I can’t even do anything with it, it’s musical chairs.",
Dad and I handled it. You wanna figure out the financing? —,
Okay. Clown time’s over. Let me in.,
He was . I’m his fucking brother. Google it. Do you know what I could do to you?,
"Hey there you are! Hiding away like a human VPN! How’s it going, dude?",
Oh. I hear you. ‘Life’. Exhausting.,
I hear you. Love pussy. You see my mom’s? —,
"Pussy. Huh. Yeah. So, look, my old man, he got grumpy this morning, but you weren’t trying to humiliate him, were you? I mean everyone says, everyone, last big legacy-content library – last fucking super-app streaming platform. We fit right?",
Hit me.,
When will he ?,
"Um, well? I couldn’t rightly say!",
"Hehehe. Yeah I mean we’re laughing but he is my dad, so that’s – pretty— You know, ‘Go easy there chief!’",
"No, I can understand that.",
"Sure. Well, look, we’re all obviously— hugely looking forward to my father dying. But there’s another shape to this.",
"Good, yeah. How about you never have to talk to him. You can work out of Austin, London, Berlin, Geneva. Totally separate corporate identity. StarGo we burn obviously.",
"GoJo full bore. Our library, our firepower and relationships for content. Good shit, not fucking, all gay moms and wheelchair kids, popular shit. And on the occasion you need to send up a smoke signal from Geneva it can all go through me. Cos we get each other.",
Oh boy is it ever!,
Yeah well a lot of that is upstream of our software and the login is—?,
"Look, I can’t piss near other men due to we don’t know what reason, but please – go ahead. Look. GoJo is your baby and we don’t want to interfere with what you do. You’re the genius. So, bearing that in mind, would you consider meeting with my dad?",
And you’d be interested in selling to us?,
Monday?,
And if I shake your hand now will I be able to tell my dad I basically just bought GoJo for him?,
Alright! Are we amazing? I think I might be the best businessman in America.,
"Um, so I dropped my phone in the urinal – oops! – would you retrieve and rice it for me? Thanks. Can you do us a bottle train, we’re celebrating?",
"A ‘bottle train’ with the – the sparklers and the fireworks and the hot girls and the whole – ‘yay I won, capitalism!’",
"Okay, here she is! Are you okay?",
Onlookers reported you having some kind of breakdown? People were anxious in case you swallowed your tongue?,
I heard it looked like a cry for help. ‘The Dance of the Sugar Plum Failure’.,
Yup.,
"Um, do you mind if I don’t say?",
"Don’t worry about it, Shivvy. Go cut a rug, I’ll handle the business.",
"I am being serious. I’ll talk to Dad, see if he wants to loop you in? He often does like to loop you in.",
Oh you’d finesse? Thank you! But how can you finesse something that’s already done? By ruining it maybe?,
Thing is Lukas and I have a connection and I don’t actually see how you fit into this?,
"Look, I know it’s been a bad day for you, what with hearing you’ve got to carry on sharing your apartment with the old meat wardrobe but try to keep your wig on, yeah?",
"Right. I saw you, sipping Dad’s champagne. You looked like you were sucking a lemon.",
Uh-huh. Were you thinking about all the dick you were going to ride while he was inside?,
"Did you think Tommy was going to jail? And Daddy was going to jail and I was going to jail and Kendall’s looney tunes? Did you think it was ladies’ night and they were playing your song? Because you were wrong. All the men have got together in man club and decided , so just .",
"Look I know it’s difficult for you. You don’t want to have to do the dance for Daddy, cos you are not a good dancer.",
Turns out he loves it when I do the daddy dance. But I guess that’s just because he loves me. He loves fucking me and he won’t fuck you.,
"Daddy doesn’t love his carrot-top anymore, even when she does her little daddy dance. — Happy birthday, motherfucker!",
—,
Oh no? Call the cops! Intruders have breached the masturbatorium!,
‘Sorry’!!,
"Oh dude, it’s too late, I already spoke to Matsson, who hates you by the way, and laughs at you constantly.",
Oh what ‘go gentle on birthday boy’?,
"What are you, fucking six? You lost. No need to be a baby about it.",
"It’s a fucking party game! He’s in Dad’s shit, we’re in his grill, everyone’s in the shit so don’t act clean.",
Oh you’re siding with traitor now?,
"Oh there’s a line now? No line for him, no line for you. But there’s a line for me? You’re a pair of stuck-up cunts who can’t fucking bear to see me win. —",
"Come on, Shitty Jesus, hit me! Punch me, Jesus! C’mon. You know you want to. Fucking prick. Happy fucking birthday, man!",
Just a little pre-meet!,
"Uh, yeah, yeah, so. We’re in discussions to acquire GoJo. —",
Um … not that advanced. Just getting to outline terms.,
"Yeah, except we’re not bopping you over the head, are we? We’re handing you a massively value-enhancing business- transformative acquisition. So, relax and think about the fucking honey, ah?",
"Well? We’re doing the dance, we’re nearly there on headline terms, and we’ll obviously value your input.",
"Uh-huh. Position A is he’s the bomb. Position B is ‘Oooh, twiddle my hispter’s tash maybe he’s  the bomb??’ But  he’s the fucking bomb. Their tech stack is sharp fucking cheddar. Their AI is terrifying. It’ll take a look at your lunch and give you six perfect suggestions for what to watch tonight with the wife the app is gonna match you with next fucking week.",
Uh-huh. I think that all worked.,
I can do it.,
No little jokes. I can do it.,
"Uh-huh. Thanks, Dad. And so you want me to send your apologies to Mom?",
Oh? Right. Yeah? I thought Peter could suck your – and she could eat your – whatever?,
Hey. I know you. Didn’t you used to be Shiv Roy?,
"Yeah at least I showed up, what were you doing? Brunching with some other sock-puppet girlboss presidents?",
"So, listen. Just to say, I’ve had Peter Onions rat-fucked.",
"The guy’s a tweedy little slime-badger. Three bankruptcies, two marriages, four kids, five shell companies. Big investor in shitty care homes. Tipping apple sauce down their gullets and telling them they had a four-course dinner.",
"So I’ve asked Mum if we can talk to her, and I think we should do it together.",
"Well, ask if she should be doing this? It’s like five months since ‘Rory’ was going to move in?",
"At least check she has a prenup. You know, she’s got all the stuff from the divorce in there, the holding company and everything and this guy is clearly on the make. So, yeah?",
‘Fuck it’?,
"Fine. Let him kill her for her emeralds and screw us out of the firm, see if I care.",
"Yeah well, you’re not really a part of that, either of you.",
"I mean I can’t quite fire you yet, Shiv, because I’m still a little scared of you. But what I’m thinking is, when I take over maybe I put you in the office next to mine and make you my sexy secretary? Sorry, Tom.",
Or I might make you my boss. And then whenever you tell me what to do I’ll tell you to fuck off.,
"Hey, you going to the welcome drinks because I’m going to hit it then I’m on with the banks, are you joining?",
Laurie Laurie Laurie. Will you  going on about him? You’re obsessed with him and it’s frankly disgusting.,
Sure. I’ll give the Swede a rub. Defrost the fucking meatball.,
"Laurie! What you got there, buddy?",
"Oh fuck yeah, tell me about it.",
"He seems great. Does he paint with a brush or his dick? Oh sorry, they’re watercolors, he doesn’t have a dick, right?",
Which? The dick pics. You don’t want pictures of my dick?,
Oh. I’m offended. Are you sure?,
Hm. Well I’m not sure. I think you do like them but you’re being kind of typically minxy.,
"Hey, Mom.",
Hey how you doing?,
Sure. Of course. And how’s business? I hear you’re big into the old silvery gulags?,
"Nah just your type. Another in the line of post-Dad posh, English phonies.",
"Easy, that’s my stepfather you’re talking about there!",
"Look, Mom, I’m not a big one for – you know, ‘saying things’ – But I’m just going to say: Are you sure about this? You know he has – like four kids?",
But do you have a prenup?,
"I’m just – a little concerned, Mom, are you rushing this?",
She ‘doesn’t want to live off macaroni and memorial services’?,
And apparently we’re meant to hate Peter because he was smart enough to get a scholarship and he bought his own furniture?,
Oh now you’re interested? She’s playing dumb. But she needs one. He’s a fucking – cad. He may be the world’s last remaining ‘bounder’.,
What do you think? Is he fucking—?,
Could be nothing. Could be just— I think it’s just fucking social media fireworks.,
"Hey, Lukas, call me. Are you high? Put the fucking venti ayahuasca Big Gulp down and call me, we need to be inside- track on this tweet, okay? I dunno. It’s his thing. He’s a trickster.",
"All under control, bro. Where you going, Naples to score junk?",
"Ooh my god, a gummy lovebite from those fucking toddlers. I think he likes us. I think he does, I feel that in my gut.",
Esports?,
Which is gravy. It’s good. This is fireworks gravy.,
"Fucking – Professor Murder She Wrote, here.",
I think we’re good.,
Okay. Here they come.,
He just does not give a single solitary fuck.,
"Shiv, don’t be silly, you have fun with Mom! I can manage, you’re not even that involved!",
Hey – what did he want?,
"I’ve tried but, no.",
I think – just bored. I mean does it change anything?,
You want me to call again? Hey. You okay?,
"Ken, he doesn’t want to see you. He doesn’t want to talk to you.",
He’s busy.,
No worries. Fun for all the family.,
Maybe? I think the boy one’s coming for you. That’s traditional.,
"Sure. No. Or, I dunno. Maybe wear a stab vest? I mean, it’d be okay. Maybe you should go? Get him out of the firm? You want me to come?",
Okay what is it?,
"Well he hates the phone, that doesn’t mean anything. I told Dad he hates the phone. He left me a voice memo. The tweets were fucking around. His lawyers have given him the Reg FD scares. He’s flying back to his Swiss place. There’s clarification coming.",
"Well he’s not. He just needs to ride it out. We don’t want to panic, Gerri, okay?",
"Well you are because you’re interrupting a great night, I’m getting very pally with Laurie. I might try to fuck him, see how that fits into our whole disgusting mess.",
Well sure. Does Dad want me to?,
"Hey dipshit. Hands off. Just off to save the world. Should be back for dinner. Greg, make sure the Contessa is kept occupied. But don’t look at her, everyone can see what you’re thinking and it’s disgusting.",
Fuck you.,
Amazing place.,
No?,
"Well don’t start telling me real shit, man, because I’m giving you nothing!",
Me? Worst?,
"Well I’m definitely not telling you a single one of my weaknesses, ever.",
"Right. Know that one. So listen, the tweet? Seriously, what was that?",
"But like, what you got cooking? Anything big coming out for you?",
"I mean were you trying to give your share price a pop by tweeting unverifiable information outside normal disclosure channels? But look, what I need to know is do you want this deal? Are you into the deal?",
"Okay. Because, I’m going to Milan to lock things down with Dad and the bankers – and the tweeting didn’t feel great, if you’re trying to blow this up, you can tell me. Yeah?",
I think it’s over.,
"Yeah, I’m not sure he is interested in getting acquired. I think he’s angling for a merger of equals.",
So it’s dead. Right?,
"Well thanks, Ger. I’m already so fucking stressed I’m jerking dust. Shall we tell him together?",
"Well, he’s a serious person.",
"Yes, Shiv, he’s serious. But. Dad, he thinks there’s value that isn’t priced in yet. Matsson’s gunning for a for a – merger of equals. So. I guess. You know? That probably—",
"He’s got twelve of the prime Asian sports leagues signed up for GoJo. He’s gonna fold it all in to the platform: live sports, games and betting. It’s a growth bomb.",
"Yes, Siobhan.",
No. The tweeting was a move.,
No. He’s on the snake. I know people. I’m a people-sniffer.,
He’s not a clown. He’s a motherfucker. It’s what you would have done. Right? He’s maximized leverage.,
Sure and I mean he wants the label but I think we could still be the puppy-fuckers here?,
"I think he’d let us craft it so we keep the balance of the board. I think he wants the freedom and he wants the status. GoJo Royco. Who gives a fuck? Give him the logo, we take the wheel.",
"But I’m sure you can trust Dad, guys?",
"‘Merger’ is really a state of mind, right? Dad, Gerri, you stay with your hands on the tiller. Their price rise is real. Proper fucking streamer. The future is movies, TV, music, games, sports, esports, AR, VR, betting – everything, to everyone. Matsson knows how to get there.",
Okay!,
"No, Dad, it’s just like – ‘Here’s my dick.’",
People just send each other pics of their dicks?,
Have you heard of dick pics?,
"I dunno. It’s like, ‘here’s my dick,’ I guess.",
Tabitha? She’s amazing. But we’re having some issues. And I hope this isn’t going to effect how we structure the negotiations going forward because I am inside this with Matsson and—,
I’m just screwing around!,
What happens now?,
"Yeah, Ger, you jump on the grenade. Thanks, pal.",
Why do you love trying to hurt me do you think?,
"I do know what you tried to do, you know, with Dad?",
Yeah once I explained it was just a fun tactic to undermine a female colleague he was actually really into it. He wants me to teach him.,
"Dad’s whole career is kind of one big dick pic sent to Western civilization, so?",
Oooh. Waitress service. Can I get a Cuba Libre and a club sandwich?,
"Go on, Willa, marry him! He’ll probably only last like ten years then it’s all gravy.",
"Greg, please concentrate. Your smile makes you look like a simpleton. Who’s that from?",
"Do not try to compete with me, Greg, I will destroy you. I will strip you down and sell you to an ostrich farm.",
Absolutely not. You have to auction. Where you going? Off to munch the farmer’s turnips with the rest of the herd?,
"Jesus. Look at her. Do you think good people cheat at , Shiv?",
"‘Ooooh I’m Shiv, I’m having a nervie B – I can’t get out of bed, bring more jello, Poppa’s gonna merge and leave me out in the cold.’",
Kurt Cobain of the fucking floaties.,
"Sure. But listen, if you find him in the pool again, there’s a C- note in it if you let him sink.",
Hey.,
"Oh, come on.",
Well. Okay. See you at the royal wedding.,
new lawyers?,
Mmm. Good instinct.,
"Oh, man.",
"Hey, Dad, all good?",
Should I jump on this or—?,
"Okay well, sure. It was heading that way.",
"Hey, don’t get sweaty, Betty. I’ll figure it all out and drop you an email.",
"You want me to come, Dad?",
"Okay, Dad?",
Oh sure. Yeah. Yup. —,
"No, Dad. Jesus. Do we have to—? The thing – I was just being horrible. It’s all good.",
"Hey, Dad—?",
"And I told Dad gaming, the cloud gaming?",
Yeah we don’t love Mark.,
We hear you have problems with binge and burn. We’ve got the good stuff.,
He’s in great shape. You know who he’s fucking?,
"Hey, Dad—?",
So – how was the ? Did you get to pay some income tax for the novelty value?,
Do you mind? I’m just all churned up about my big bro and I can’t think about that shit?,
"Sure. No, I don’t want you to die— Yeah. So.",
"Dude, you kind of tried to kill yourself and that’s not cool.",
Oh sure.,
"Well that may well be true, but you’re top of the pile right now, we’ll do mine tomorrow.",
"Hey, Con?",
But we’re not saying anything.,
It’s okay.,
What’s that?,
He’s him.,
All will be revealed. All will be revealed.,
"And do you not think, maybe one last check with Mom?",
Right. I just don’t know if he – you know? (Loves Mom.),
I am worried about the prenup.,
"But what if he poisons her, what if he pushes her down the stairs to get this flat he so loves?",
"Yeah, fuck off.",
Yeah yeah.,
Relax. It’s – cool beans.,
"Hey congrats, man. Finally ground her down.",
Is it the dried penis of one of the great men of history? Genghis Khan? Bing Crosby?,
Excuse me?,
Dad is—? Dad’s working on his jissom? Are you fucking kidding me?,
Are you serious? Dad’s scrambling the fighters?,
Okay well we need a plan to kill this baby.,
"What, in the spawn chamber, issuing his hellseed? Sure.",
"You two? Tom, you know her ovaries are covered in teeth, right? Her womb isn’t a womb, it’s a spiritual vacuum. She has canines where the eggs should be.",
"No, I think if Shiv could have kids it would have happened by now. Because she’s had a lot of sex with a lot of men.",
"You’re freezing? You know what she’s waiting for, don’t you, Tom? She’s gonna make you carry it.",
Seriously you’re gonna have to shit your own baby. Then squeeze your Tommy tits for man-milk. —,
Could be a number of things.,
"This is fine, this is good. But look. I’ll hit Kerry – will you take Marcia? Find out who’s up with Dad?",
Feel free to cut him dead by the way.,
"Sure, I don’t want to be rude but he’s what we call in our land ‘an irrelevant pauper’. You don’t need to listen to the pauper. It’s not for your royal ears.",
"Yeah so listen, kidding aside, I hear you might have been getting some tremors on the assistant loop?",
"Uh-huh? And when the company merges would you like to be inside or would you maybe like to be back at the turkey farm, taking the blind ones out to shit?",
"Thank you. I’m going to have vaginal sex in the missionary position with her, like a total fucking normo so leave well alone.",
Hey so excuse me but what did you say to Gerri just there?,
Uh-huh? And why are you lying? Did he tell you to lie?,
"Are you trying to have my dad’s baby? Because that’s an incredibly bad idea. It would be born old, attached to a walker. So – I think Karl and Frank are in Europe. There’s a bunch of new M&A advisors in Chianciano.",
"Euro ring. Hey Karlo! How you doing? Where are you, man? At – the office yeah? In your office? Great, well I’ll leave you to get on with your office job. Motherfucker. Marcia?",
"Look, um – so I should probably say, in terms of the meeting—? Matsson did kind of float, as an idea – maybe they buy us?",
"No I mean, yeah. He was like ‘no way, fuck you’.",
"Can we not make it a thing right away? We don’t know. Matsson pitched Dad the idea of them eating us, but I think he was flying a kite and Dad kind of shut it down.",
"I can’t remember the exact number of expletives, Siobhan. I’m not a fuckometer. —",
"Ken, what you think, he would never sell, would he?",
Ken?,
Is he shitting?,
"It’s okay, Ken.",
"I know, man. I know. You fucked it.",
"It’s just business. We’re all fucked, it’s okay. We’re all fucked. It all just got mixed up.",
Uh-huh.,
"Well, whatever, you’re – fine.",
"Oh come on, we’re kids. You’re not—",
Bullshit. C’mon. Bullshit.,
"I mean, if it pleases the court, you didn’t kill him, I mean sounds like he – killed him?",
I mean the road killed him? The road and the water killed him?,
"I mean so you, crashed, and you— What, then you, ran?",
"Well, see?",
"You dived? Like twice? I mean, that is actually kind of the story of a hero? I woulda been straight out of there? I woulda been out of that water like a fucking tabby cat out the bath, bro!",
"Bullshit. Nah, sounds like you’re at worst you’re an – irresponsibler. At very worst. You’re being very self-dramatizing with the murderer talk, actually. You’re bigging yourself up. At worst you’re a manslaughter-er.",
"Let’s get him back into the chapel, stuff him in a confessional and fix this. Who are you calling?",
"Oh great. Leave me with all the feeling. Thanks. What? I mean who hasn’t clipped the odd kid with a Porsche? It’s a rite of passage. I’ve killed a kid. Have you killed a kid, Shiv?",
"See, one waiter down. That’s why it took so long to get a fucking drink at her wedding.",
"No sure. I get it. I’m just saying, I’m the real victim here, I waited three-quarters of an hour for a gin and tonic.",
Can we trust that?,
"Nothing. I just don’t see a sale because, how would Dad be in charge?",
Okay so how does that work? How would he stay in charge?,
I just don’t see it.,
No way he fucks us.,
"Because. I think, I think he kind of does love us?",
"This is rumors. I will need to talk to him direct, just me.",
I am just saying as a matter of fact Dad and I have been working closely lately. I don’t wanna go in too aggressive.,
I’m not busting in there crying with Team Shiv. Okay? We have no idea how this will play out.,
I just don’t think we go in aggressive. I mean can we even actually stop him?,
I’m not sure I want to pull out something like that. Maybe I stick with what I have?,
I think with Dad pulling strings—,
"You see I want to disagree. But I’m scared, if I do, he’ll just off me. Drive us all into the sea.",
"What, too soon?",
And the holding-company move. That’s real?,
"But really equal? You two cunts don’t fucking big brother me out of my fucking piece here, okay?",
And the old guard?,
"And I have like four pieces of rat-fuck that kill Karl. I do think. That – although this literally makes me want to puke and I will want to kill you both every day and it all will end horribly – nevertheless, I do think we could, puke, make a, quote, pretty good team.",
"Well, Con, this  me layering you in. I can’t explain everything because it’s complicated and there’s no time and you’re a little slow – I’m kidding! But we wanted to tell you because you’re big brother and all. Well I understand …",
You can handle this?,
"Me? No, as long as you bitches don’t go waterpistols in Bali?",
"We were all gonna go in and squirt? Dad, under his canopy? I went and you fucks left me for dead?",
Convenient.,
"Hey, you, lawyery man, what’s that? Where’s Logan Roy?",
"Um, hey. Hey, all? Just feeling a bit out of the loop, Dad?",
"Yeah, um, we might have this wrong but we heard rumors about GoJo?",
It might be better – to – just so we all hear. —,
"I know what he said, Dad, but, really? Once Matsson’s calling the shots, we’re strung up in the town square.",
"Dad, we are here to say, the three of us to ask, and to say: Please do not do this.",
You need our vote for a change of control.,
Dad—?,
"Oh fuck, Mom – he got to you? —",
"Dad, please?",
"Dad, please. I dunno. Love?",
"Dad, why?",
"Con? Was it Con? Help us, Gerri. He’s not well. Help us stop him.",
Why? Because you’re Shiv’s fucking godmother.,
"Why, because I trust you. I fucking like you.",
"Frank? Fine, fuck you. You bitter, fucking shoe.",
I know you think I’m dumb. But you can’t see what I’ve got—,
Fuck you.,
"Um, no. Next. Right, fuckchops?",0
Exciting.,1
Hard no.,0
But go on. I do like them. We do. It’s just they’re kind of shitty.,1
I mean we can be honest here?,0
No. I feel like we said ‘iconic’ but you’re leaning ironic. What?,1
"Well don’t patronize me, bitch.",0
Whereas you can only get hard looking in the mirror. It’s true. I hear he got holes drilled in his full-length mirror and his butler stuffs it with kiwis so he can fuck himself awake.,0
Cool. You look tired and your face is giving me a headache.,1
"So, where have you been?",0
"Great, amazing, fantastic, guys. Love it, look forward to it. Great to see you thanks so much goodbye forever.",1
We hear you’re talking with the Jiménez transition team?,0
"Oh, no? No? It’s no, so that’s lies from our friend who told us? They’re lying to us?",1
"So, you  talking?",0
"Well obviously Dad is going to sell. We’re looking at fucking logos here, I’ve drafted a resignation statement from Waystar? Yeah?",0
"Scared of needles, not a real junkie.",1
Do you think it’s too small-scale?,0
"No! My only thing with The Hundred is, is it literally too good. Like why hasn’t anyone else done it?",0
"Oooh, we get to run the deck with you? Like we’re at Cyrus Tellis’ business school?",1
"It’s an indispensable, bespoke, information hub.",0
"Every actionable piece of information in the world, on tap, provided in hourly updates across curated verticals in all meaningful areas of: news, finance, sex, food, sports. Inside- inside-inside baseball shit.",0
"It’s clickbait, but for smart people.",0
Shiv?,0
"Yeah? You know what, T, can they give us two?",0
"Tell them they can shove their petrodollars up their human rights record – we need to talk to our sister, okay?",1
You think? What?,0
"Board meeting day after tomorrow? He sells up, but with ATN spun off?",0
Or it’s a brain-fuck? Dad twisting our turnips and playing the fuck trombone?,1
"Hey, Telly?!",0
"Um, one query – Pierce/PGN – what’s the vibezz? Are they in play?",0
Another ten?,0
Oh  not feeling well?,1
"No fine. Tell them I’m – whatever – sudden onset violent diarrhea. I’m sitting on the bathroom floor shooting rusty water through the eye of a needle. Huge apologies. So, you two are thinking we should be buying Pierce? Because that’s obviously what you’re thinking and just to say: it’s quite the fucking pivot.",1
"‘Fuck The Hundred’? Shiv, after Dubai you were high as shit on it. It was basically your idea!",0
"Right, launch a high-visibility execution-dependent disruptor news brand while also performing CPR on the fucking – corpse of a legacy media conglomerate?",0
"Oh yeah, ‘Hey Tellis would you prefer five million in fees from a funding round or thirty-five million from an acquisition?’",1
I thought we were going for The Hundred? Small. New. Fast on our feet?,0
"No! Ken, it’s just fucking – old. You’ve spent the last three months fucking hustling us contributors and backers and—",0
Can we even afford it?,0
But you loved it!,0
"Oh,  her.",1
"Listen, should we just tell her to fuck off? Not go back to the mat with Dad and just – you know, back into that fucking room?",0
Oh for fuck’s sake.,0
And so until now you were just stringing us along?,1
"Alright, Molto Agitato, you wanna fly there? Like Nan Pierce’s little Windsor Dog Show bitch?",1
"Well we’re not getting on a plane without an NDA so we can see everything under that cronky old fucking hood. Look. I’m worried. I am. You wanna fuck Dad. You wanna fuck Tom. I’m the only one who wants to set up a business as a business, that doesn’t wanna fuck anyone.",1
Yeah. I don’t believe you.,0
Please. Guys. Really?,0
"But can’t we do that, but, like, without a banner for Dad?",0
"Uh-huh, well it took long enough. What is it, a fucking goose with a saddle?",1
"What the— Sorry, is this me?",0
Well it’s weird. Where did they get the photo?,0
"Yeah well it makes me want to join ISIS, okay? Stop it. Jess?",1
You gonna?,0
"Well hello, Kerry. And how are you doing?",1
Yeah we’re – in transit and—,0
"Um, that was my sister saying that I’d hear you better if you took Dad’s cock out of your mouth?",1
Would we consider at least a call?,0
Did Dad ask?,0
"Look if he was to call, we could see.",0
"Oh we actually know him quite well, Kerry. I mean we’ve never licked his big omelette nipples but—",1
"I am going to need to hear that voice I’m afraid, Kerry? —",1
"How’s your vineyard, Shiv?",0
"Uh-huh. Brave. Fighting through all the chiffon, eating all that chicken breast. Fucking Che Guevara.",1
"Oh, we get to talk to an old lady about newspapers now? Amazing! Thank you  much.",1
We’re fine. It’s a complicated private situation.,1
"Okay, well, lovely trip, great to see you guys!",1
"Don’t worry, she doesn’t care, she isn’t really a human being.",0
"Sure, confusing. What comes after nine? There must be some planet brain out there who can figure it out. Whither Hawking?",1
Oh she appreciates?,1
"You fucking jerking off to your yacht catalogue there, T?",1
"He’s going to bill us two hundred mil for that strategy advice. Thanks, T.",1
Fucking Tom’s on this for Dad?,0
"Go first, Tommy. Build the trust, bro.",0
"So we think Dad’s around eight-five, nine, so we’re nine-five to top them out? But ten to show we’re really serious? So, the half-bil extra is just – that’s just an extra half-bil?",0
That’s a pretty penny for a conversation-ender? Can’t we just fart?,1
"Oh it rounds it out, it does that, it makes it  divisible. You do know what half a billion dollars is? Five hundred million dollars?",1
"A million is a thousand thousands. You do know that. So this is five hundred times one thousand, thousand dollars of actual money you could spend on fucking – snowmobiles and sushi.",1
Sure but is it worth it?,0
"Man, I wish I went to Harvard Business School like you, T. Did they crochet that onto your ballsack?",1
many olds. They’re running a silver mine over there. Where are the hotties?,0
Bloodlust! God our PGN will crush this peanut brittle.,0
"Creative retreat, Telly. Blue-sky. No bad ideas, except yours.",1
Sorry – I just can’t seem to tear my eyes away from the bald man talking about NATO.,1
You would not watch that.,0
"Or? Shove all your farm report, melatonin news-hour info dumps into daytime and primetime, we go full  — this is the world, feast your peepers on its horrible delights!",0
"Dad occasionally had some success running a news network, Siobhan?",1
Yeah. An environmental show but not all doom and gloom?,0
Not all of it? Sharks?,0
All good?,0
"Dad would shit. There’s fruit on the table I don’t know, and I know my fucking fruit.",0
Man. Dad was a god. Tomorrow he’s selling the empire to a 4chan Swede and dishing out jobs for BJs.,0
That voice! Vocal-fry Goebbels. What the fuck is that?,0
Hugo – no question. Absolutely.,0
Excuse me?,0
We’re good. We’ll just jump in and figure it out—,0
"We have to be somewhere and if we don’t take that chopper— I will set aside several hundred thousand dollars, and I will dedicate it to destroying your life.",0
Oh you can’t speak to that?,1
What’s it doing?,0
It’s fucking nuts. We’re going to be late. Connor’s gonna shit. It’ll be guilt trip to the moon. Do we call. Maybe this is a mistake?,0
"Oh great, what? Getting stuck in traffic with all the fucking, traffic fucks.",1
"Uh-huh. Hey, Buddha, nice Versaces.",1
Sandy? The brain in a jar with a dildo attached?,1
"Tonight? Nah. It’s the board again. Right? Stewy’s been saying Sandy thinks there’s more juice in the Swede, are they flying that again?",0
"Well they can’t— We’ll be at the rehearsal dinner. So, no, right? I don’t want it to get all hokey.",0
"Late for Connor’s rehearsal? Even later. Nah, I think it’s just fuckery.",0
"Oh come on. It’s done. Dad’s lots of things, but no one ever accused him of being soft on a deal. It’s fuckery.",0
"I mean I love the idea of not going. But I think we have to drink at least a couple of Martini Passive-Agressos to make up, no?",1
Hey? What the fuck?,0
"Well more than— What is this, an ambush?",1
I don’t think so. Okay – see you!,1
"Look, I think our position might be that we’re done cornholing our dad.",1
Yeah sorry. Willa? You okay?,1
Is it over?,0
"The bride is normally, I guess, is generally considered one of the first team at the old wedding?",1
"Um, no. I guess?",0
Um. I don’t know?,0
"Oh, man.",0
I think it seems like we should?,0
That bullshit?,0
"You okay, man?",0
We saw Willa?,0
"Nah, come on, Con, you’re good. Throw her another ten K? Snowmobile and some teeth-whitening vouchers? I’m kidding.",1
"Shiv, he looks pretty rough?",0
"Sandi’s a greedy little bitch, she’s got her hand up the ass of the carcass of her dad, Stewy’s come along for the ride. It’s a packet of horseshit.",1
Would it be possible to do anything other than that in the entire universe also including mainlining ratshit?,1
I mean we can do one drink though? Yeah? Little bachelor party?,0
Do you think they know the recipe for a vodka tonic?,1
"Hey, Con? You with us?",0
Sure. On another guy’s dick. Sorry. Too soon.,0
We’re eating. Right here in Billy Ray Cyrus’s Kentucky Fried Shit Shack?,0
And what was that?,0
Oh fuck. What now?,0
Oooh ‘wings’. I wonder from which particular creature they snipped these ‘wings’? You think a mammal?,1
Oh my god yes. It’s quite the compendium of delights! I think I’ll be ordering off-chef.,1
"We’ll get back to you, we’re gonna order off-restaurant.",0
Why don’t we fold Con in?,0
"But he has a share. If the deal collapses, he’ll lose his payout?",0
Shiv wants to get us mixed up in some drug deal to screw the vote tomorrow.,0
Oh what the fuck now?,0
Really?,0
Exactly. Maybe .,0
I don’t know. Ask him.,0
I dunno. Sure. It’s just a check-in.,0
No. Look – I guess he’s got voting fears. He’s got the vibrations.,0
"My phone? No! Look, I said one happy birthday, I said sorry we missed it. This is – now an unprovoked check-in.",0
Drama queen.,0
"So, never? Fuck you, looky-lookies.",0
Show us your phone. World’s biggest WhatsApp group for sharing shots of your snatch. Fuck you. No.,0
Are you fucking serious? Oh my god you’re serious. My god.,0
"Fine, fucking bullshit. It’s mostly dick pics I sent him anyway. He kind of got a taste for them.",0
Why? What did I say?,0
"He’s our dad, what do you want me to say, ‘Happy birthday hope you fall down the stairs, shithead’?",0
Fuck you ‘betrayal’. ‘Happy birthday take care’?,0
"Fucking family guilt trip, European vacation.",0
"I’m sure there’s maybe one more horrible motherfucker lawyer left in the United States, if you really look? But I’m sorry.",0
"But we want to do Pierce, we wanna get out?",0
But Matsson won’t go up in price. I know. I spoke to him earlier.,0
"Yeah, he’s secretive. But we’re tight.",0
"Look, he thinks I’m fucking cool and he tells me everything. And he told me, this is his ceiling.",0
Seriously. I think he might walk.,0
He sounded like he meant it.,0
"I don’t give a shit about conflict, I’m in constant fucking conflict.",0
If anyone’s got Dad feelings it’s you. Poking Satan with a – fork. I’m fucking genuine about us three.,0
"Fine. Fine. Just spare me the fucking talking to, okay? Stop fucking ganging up on me like you’re Lennon and McCartney and I’m George. I’m John. You’re Ringo. You’re Yoko. And he’s the drummer from Wings.",0
It’s just a move?,0
"Then I guess, so long as it’s a play I’m in.",0
I would imagine that’s a yes. Longest night of my life.,1
"I would agree. Don’t listen to Shiv, Con. Do not let Willa go.",1
What do we do? Should we leave? Will he come in? He won’t come in?,0
"This is some Guantanamo-level shit. What is this? Con. I think I want ‘Desperado’? Please? Okay, I don’t know why he’s calling me?",0
I’m not! Hey! You could’ve just let it ring out?,0
I don’t think he’d come?,0
‘My Dad’s a Media Mogul and a Terrible Scary Bastard’. It’s an album track.,1
Says the woman who’s been making him jizz into a cup so she can create a monstrous Frankenbaby.,0
"He’s not going to come, right?",0
Too late to jump out a window? Hari-karaoke?,1
"Yeah, this is family fuck-fuck.",0
It’s maybe more complicated than that.,1
Oh? You’re not gonna be on TV?,0
"What are you apologizing for, Dad?",1
"Are we actually doing this, Dad? Cos. I think. You know. Seriously what fucked all this was … when … with Mom and Italy and …",0
"Well, no. Everyone hit me. I’m annoying.",1
What kind of—? One of the bad ones?,0
"What is this, Dad?",0
So you actually don’t have cancer?,1
I feel like I might be getting cancer now?,1
Nuts. We should check that out though.,1
"Yeah, uh-huh. Cool.",0
"Hey, Dad. And looky looky here. Twin Cities Tessie. Thought I smelled dairy. So yeah, just felt that got weird and there was a lot going on.",0
"Oh yeah? I mean, it’s the wedding. Con’s wedding? But – feels, yeah, let’s see—",0
What about Tommy Two-Tits?,0
Uh. Sure. I didn’t come to – to you know—,0
Maybe I should go?,0
Nah. No.,0
Uh-huh.,0
You really want me? At ATN?,0
"Well, it sounds good. Can I think about it? But it does.",0
Oh? Okay. Um. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Um—,0
Just only thing is. Con’s wedding?,0
Are you gonna make it at all?,0
"It’s his wedding day, Dad. I don’t want him to shit his bag. You know?",0
"Right. But also, I guess. The sort of shift in things with— I haven’t actually told Ken and Shiv yet, that I might not be following through on our plans and—",0
Uh-huh. I will. Maybe not today.,0
Right.,0
"Yeah. No, sure.",0
Uh-huh?,0
Oh yeah?,0
"Oh right. Right. Okay. Well, let’s discuss?",0
Me?,0
Dad?,0
Well. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Yeah?,0
Yes I am. Why?,0
"I’m fine, Shiv. Let’s just enjoy the freak show.",0
"No. Jesus Christ, Tom. I just spoke to him. She’s not here yet.",0
Yes I am going to do it.,0
"I’ll let you know, okay? Back off, inflatable dicky-dick?",0
"Hey, Ger. How you doing? You look – well.",0
"And nothing. You look, healthy.",1
I was being nice. Can a guy not be nice anymore? Happy whatever. Happy Whoremas.,0
What what?,0
What? I’ll stare right in your stupid face if that’s what you so desperately desire.,1
"Nothing. You just make me go weird, as you know and fully intend. Look, let’s talk. Later. In thirty. Once we set sail?",0
"I just need to talk with you and we should do it later. It’ll be better, because— No doubt you can tell from looking at me, it’s not great. But my dad said it, so— It’s a message, really.",0
"Look, it’s not official, and, it’s a heads-up from me, but yeah, they’re gonna stuff your mouth with gold, and it’s all good and maybe we can talk him down but yeah as an early warning and I didn’t intend to get into this – but yeah.",0
He’s unhappy about how long it took you to settle with the DOJ.,0
And the number – the fine. Too big.,0
I guess you’ve lost his confidence.,0
"No, don’t be so stupid and reductive.",0
"Oh fuck off, Gerri, don’t moan. You’re not a moaner.",0
"No. I don’t know. Gerri, don’t be weird. This will all be totally fine. It’s nothing, so shut up. I’m doing you a courtesy by letting you know. You can go legal but we’ll stuff your mouth with so much fucking gold and that’s just how it’s going to go. You wrote the playbook, Gerri.",0
"I am, on a ‘human level’, obviously sad so— I am sorry. And off the record, Ger. I do perhaps owe you the opportunity to throw your shit at the wall?",0
"Dad. Can you call me back? That was— It was horrible. With Gerri. So. I’m just— I dunno if— Don’t listen to this if you don’t want to but I’m, I’m not totally okay with … Are you being kinda shitty with me? Cos your son’s getting married and you can’t just – fucking keep expecting me to bend over for you being cunty. I’m just asking. Yeah so that’s the question. Are you a cunt? Give me a buzz!",0
— the funny farm—,0
"And um, Willa – I’m looking forward to saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and mixing it up and whatnot. But is there also an area that is – if we don’t wanna get Roy-ed by the Big Gulps?",0
Thank you. I mean I wanna meet everyone and get into it all about their jobs and children and everything but – you know?,1
Me? No idea. I don’t know.,0
"Don’t talk to him, he’s a filthy pornographer.",0
She’s a good person. She’s like a decent human being.,1
"Hello, fucky sucky brigade, how can I help you?",0
What?,0
"Dad’s sick. How sick? What is it? Hello? Tom, what’s happening, what’s going on?",0
Oh fuck.,0
"And the – the – machine, the— You have a—",0
"Who is that, what is that?",0
Why does Frank think that?,0
"What the fuck do you mean, Tom? —",0
Well should they be?,0
"Are you serious, Frank, fuck me.",1
Can you even breathe without – heart— Can you?,0
We’ll get Shiv.,0
"Can he hear, is he okay? Is he okay?",0
"Hey, Dad. Um. I hope you’re okay. You’re okay. You’ll be okay, alright? You’re a monster. You’re a, you’re a fucking Trojan. You’re going to win this okay? I – I don’t know. You’re good. You’re a good dad. You’re a good dad. You did a good job. I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I can’t do this.",0
I don’t fucking know.,0
It’s okay. You’re a good guy. You’re a good guy. They think he’s gone now.,0
They think Dad died.,0
I’m sorry.,0
"He’s been putting us by Dad’s ear, to speak.",0
I don’t know.,0
"Go private. Just speak. It’s weird, but speak. You never know?",0
What’s happening? What precisely is happening now?,0
"Okay, so they’re still doing the chest compressions?",0
Yeah well do— Who is their medical people. Who the fuck are these people? Who are they? Tom?,0
"Okay. And they’re what, in contact? Direct, another line?",0
"But that doesn’t mean he’s dead? Medically, right.",0
"Do those fucking clowns know what they’re doing though, Tom? Are they hurting him?",0
When are you gonna land? Are you turned around? Are you coming back?,0
What did Frank say?,0
"Tom’s open but there’s nothing to say. They’re, doing – they’re still doing it.",0
Tom said like forty minutes.,0
Right.,0
He got short of breath?,0
"There was like no time, Shiv.",0
What was he— [doing?] Was he  his phone. Do we know if he checked his messages? Is anything happening?,0
Oh Jesus.,0
I don’t know. I don’t know if I said – good things?,0
Yeah I don’t know what I said? What did I say?,0
Uh-huh. Did I say I loved him?,0
"This is so fucking— Tom, can you put the phone back with him maybe? Or I don’t know. I don’t— Shall we just leave it open here?",0
Oh fuck. We should tell Con. We should get Connor?,0
"Can you, Ken? I don’t think I can. I could, but— [I’d be really grateful.]",0
I mean do we definitely tell him?,0
"Sure. I mean, just to be nice, would it be, better to, like there’s nothing he can ?",0
"Too weird, too weird. No, go.",0
"Hey, Con. I’m sorry.",0
There. People. People came. I couldn’t speak to—,0
"I said, ‘Hello fucky sucky brigade,’ and he was in the bathroom.",0
"Yeah, I don’t know, he was in trouble and—",0
"We don’t, I mean we don’t actually know, like we don’t  he’s gone.",0
"I think we just need to get him back, we need to get him back and find out, like what is going on, it may be, fucking, those goons, it may be, you know. We don’t actually know anything really. Fucking Tom.",0
We need to get some proper doctors in there.,0
Yeah well we don’t know that – so?,0
"I’m not saying anything, all I am saying is we don’t actually know.",0
Oh what I’m fucking ?,0
Yeah we don’t know shit. They’re still working on him.,0
Anything could be happening. Could be a fucking hoax. It could. What if it’s a drill? What if it’s all a big test? Ah?,0
It just does not feel very likely to me that he is dead?,0
I don’t know if they should though?,0
Should they cover him actually in case— [he needs to breathe or something?],0
I think we’re going.,0
"Hey, guys. You’re on speakerphone.",0
Oh it’s a ?,1
I’m welling up.,1
"He might not be dead. I mean he might be but all the information we have is from some fucking – corporate bozos and some airplane sluts. They probably tried to resuscitate him by blowing up his dick. No doctor has actually seen him. I know what is likely but I am actually not being crazy. Mad shit happens. It’s fucking five, three percent possible. That is all I am saying so don’t look at me like I’m five fucking years old.",0
"Oh, pretty significant. For him, we’re talking top ten right?",1
I think we should get him down.,0
Hugo. Easy. She’s doing her best.,0
"No, it’s okay, it’s sensible. I know you’re glad he’s dead and you want to grab the crown.",1
"I did say I loved him, didn’t I? Did I?",0
"I feel like I didn’t. I spoke to him twice, right, once, then you went to get Shiv? What was it like when he told you, Shiv?",0
We don’t have to. We don’t have to do anything. Our dad died.,0
"Oh, man. How?",0
Right.,0
Um. Yeah. Same. Can’t think.,0
Yeah.,0
Yeah?,0
"I just don’t know if I can, literally, do anything, or talk to anyone.",0
We don’t want to just let Karolina handle?,0
"Uh-huh. Well, I mean, I would, I don’t want anything happening we don’t, like approve. So. Yeah. Yeah?",0
"Oh, man, I didn’t really want to do anything.",0
Hey.,0
"Yeah. Um, I need the room.",0
I’m pretty sad.,0
"Yeah. I mean I’m actually – right now. I’m totally numb. But yeah, theoretically, you would say, I’m – yeah, sad.",0
"Yeah. And – I don’t know, what happens – about earlier. I actually called him back and I called him – a— I said he was a cunt or something.",0
So. That’s nice to know. It was like a joke I guess. But. What a fucking mess. —,0
"Good. No still excited. Very excited. Full steam ahead. I think. More to follow, Lukas, more to follow. Yeah. I’ll pass that on to, to him. It is serious. It’s serious, but hoping for the best. Hoping for the best. We’ll let you know. Thanks, Lukas. Urgh. Didn’t feel great. But I guess. We can explain.",0
"Well, just sort of – steady as she goes.",0
"Well, we’re already full steam ahead so – full steam ahead is steady as she goes? What? I didn’t even want to fucking call.",0
"That’s just – a continuation. He just died, Ken. Man. It wasn’t a move.",0
Are we gonna be okay?,0
"Yeah, you’re not gonna be okay. You’re fucked. You are completely fucked.",0
There’s Dad. You see him? We gonna go look?,0
I don’t know. Should we?,0
"I dunno. I think, I think I’m going to see him? Yeah. You coming?",0
"Hey, man.",0
Marcia? The belle of the ball.,0
In Marcia’s trunk. Inside an anaconda. Inside a sarcophagus.,1
"I can do a phone-sex bit if you want. I thought you might not be in the mood? Yeah, I’m actually fine. I mean I’m sure it’ll crush me eventually. Freight train coming – but today – I’m okay.",0
"I wonder if I thought about it so much, one way and another, maybe I’ve, I don’t know – pre-grieved?",0
"I know he’s – gone, I do know that. But I’ve maybe sad-hacked it, thought it out?",0
"I guess I’ve been paying into a grief bank for years, so, I’m sad – but I’m fine.",0
Right.,0
He was gonna fire half that room. Do people know that? Should we get that out?,0
"We’re not playing Chutes and Ladders, Greg. Our dad just died.",0
"You need to find a new mommy, we’re not your mommy. Um. Matsson. Do I?",0
"Hey? Oskar? Um. Roman Roy, Lukas called but I was just rounding up my chimpanzee friends because they wanted to say hi too. Is he there?",1
Oh right? Can you get him?,0
Thank you. Yes. Yes.,1
"Okay. Okay, man. Great. Okay, well. Jesus fucking Christ.",1
Only really if he saw a hobo on fire.,1
"To be honest, from where I’m sitting, it’s you guys who look naive. I’ve been worrying this was going to happen for ages. How are you?",0
You’re going to destroy this.,1
The reviews are in.,0
Bit racist.,1
Never paid a penny in US tax.,1
Now that’s unfair. I think ‘well connected’ is generally accepted to be a euphemism for pedophile? And no one ever suggested —?,1
Oh shit! It’s ! Who’s got to marry who? Is Connor the child of an oak tree?,1
Uh-huh. From when?,0
Yeah. Yeah.,0
He’s torn it to tiny shreds but if you put it together again it reads ‘Kendall’? Kidding. I’m kidding. Let me see?,0
"Ken, sure, man, I get it, but, it’s old. You tried to send him to jail like twelve times since then?",0
"So, what else does it say?",0
He has a shit-ton of investment impressionism. He’s got three Gauguin’s no one’s ever seen for tax reasons.,0
He probably wrote it to remember your name.,1
"He wanted to see less of you. That’s probably, like fifty-fifty, ‘ Greg or kill Greg’?",0
Hm. Hm. Yeah. And it is interim.,0
What you thinking? Regulatory issues? If the deal wobbled or —? What?,0
Colin does jeans?,0
What happens to Colin now? Does he go do security for Hooters?,0
"Hey Marcia, who ordered the beefcake?",0
"Right, not like all his  from – his men’s group and choir. His pals from the corner bar.",1
"Shiv, we’ve got all sorts of ghouls here. C’mon.",0
The guy might be president this time next week?,0
"Oh I think I have a counter-veto, cos, weirdly, my dad just died too?",1
"Oh what Dad’s gone, let’s get Big Bird on ATN doing round table? Do we wanna make the one thing we’re left with worse?",1
We can’t— You can’t do the Emancipation Proclamation in a day.,0
"It’s the circus. ‘If there is no God, why do walnuts look like tiny brains?’ That was a segment.",0
Who the fuck made him king of the day?,0
"Dad? Um, if you like Benny Hill and Sinatra is that an anarcho- capitalist?",1
Worst play on Broadway. Two stars. Check your brain at the door.,0
"And so, why is he doing that with his face can I ask?",1
Frozen into a – smile?,1
Uh-huh. Sure. I think he just winked at me. Can we put a drape over him? He looks like he might start dancing. I guess they were close. Dad and him?,1
"Sure. But I guess, who do we prefer, one of us or one of them?",0
"Hey, you okay.",0
I’m sorry. Do I have your private number? Will you send it.,0
Uh-huh. Sure.,1
"I can get it, it’s okay. It’s okay.",0
"‘Take her out the back, Billy.’ Always good to hear.",1
Seems a little tough?,0
Is she carrying Dad’s luggage? I don’t think so. Nah.,0
Hey.,0
I work with his barber. You?,1
Exactly. Grab a corn dog and enjoy the ride!,1
"Oh, Tommy Wamby. Tightrope Tommy. Riding his fucking subtle-cycle across Niagara Falls?",0
"Okay? Jesus Christ, does she know she can go back?",0
Shall we all move in. Like the Banana Bunch?,1
You know Peter Munion was flying to Spain and tried to fly right here. He wanted to be with us ‘at this difficult time’.,0
"Can I get you anything else, Mrs Ferreyra?",0
They wanted us to ‘shore up the midfield’ and Dad was reluctant to spend.,0
"Dude, don’t ask me. Not only did I not know Hibs were Catholic, I didn’t really know I was.‡",0
I guess I do too.,0
"Nah, I’m done with helping old ladies across the road. I just wonder about – about – about – about—",0
You know everyone remembers you trying to send him to prison?,0
"COO is on the draft plan, right? I’m a COO. I know Matsson. I was very close with Dad. We had a number of communications you were aware of and some, that honestly, now isn’t the time, but you weren’t. And yeah, I just think. We were close and— Honestly, Ken, it just, it feels better. It doesn’t feel good to us – right, Shiv, right now for it to be just you. So. Them’s my words. I don’t know, this whole thing is a big deal but I’m done fucking, twisting and turning, I’m just gonna say it.",0
Yeah?,0
Three is a bit wacky? Two is fucking. Three is a weird cuddle puddle and no one gets laid.,0
"You’re inside everything. Look. I’m not fucking anyone, this is just to sell and— Yesterday was real, it was real, we’re connected. I feel good on this. I feel really good.",0
Everything.,0
Yesterday.,0
Hey.,0
Cool. Dry opener.,0
Ha. Well. Yeah. Good. I guess that’s ‘under discussion’. Come on in.,0
You didn’t say that?,0
Well you keep working that routine.,1
Oh thanks.,1
Oh hell yeah. Yeah.,0
Let us talk to some folks.,0
This is a good group.,0
"If you’re uncomfortable you can leave, Frank. It’s a lovely gang of pals having a chat.",0
Like forty-eight hours ago?,0
Our dad was tough.,0
"I think we all know he had soured on you, Gerri?",0
We’re obviously the people to take over from Dad because we were closest to him.,0
Yeah right.,0
We know the board is very excited about the deal and so are we. It’s a good deal.,1
Yeah. Thanks. Great day. Great week.,1
God. Did you know he did Sudokus?,0
Oh Jesus Christ.,0
It’s Operation ‘Shit on Dad’.,0
Are people gonna buy that Dad was a puppet?,0
"Whoa! Yeah. I do have certain feelings of queasiness, about, I guess – shitting on our dad while he’s still up at Frank Campbell’s?",0
"Thanks, Hugo. Karolina. But never bring us this disgusting shit ever again thank you?",0
Thank you. More to follow!,0
Little bit. You get the condolence assistants?,0
"Ha! I wanted to get in early, just – getting briefed. Should I get Shiv?",0
Okaying  reshoots. Panicky vibes.,0
"Yup. I think gotta keep spending. I will say ‘no’, a lot, and shout, obviously, initially.",0
"Which, cos you sent several?",0
Yeah.,0
Yeah. Yeah.,0
"Yeah. And is it, it’s not  plane?",0
I mean I’m sure I’d be fine but—,0
Okay. Here we go: March of the Emperor Penguins.,0
What is this? Coming to re-interview for your jobs?,1
I think we checked in on the board call? And on the follow-up call and with your thirty-three thousand emails?,1
Yeah we’re not Dad. We are collegiate motherfuckers. The game goes: confirm the deal is on. Reaffirm structure and the ATN spin-off.,0
But we fuck-out the idea the post-Dad price fall has anything to do with the underlying value.,0
"Unscheduled, Shiv. Mom and Dad just stopped by to make sure we have food in the fridge.",1
"Um, sorry. But Matsson, asking— He’s saying not to freak out?",0
Okay. So that’s sinister as fuck.,0
But why does he want to check cultural compatibility if we haven’t done the deal?,0
"Great. You hang a disco ball in the cabin, my dad still died on it.",0
No it’s not even the emotional – just in terms of simple – hygiene.,0
Sure but – the actual,0
Nevertheless. I might – make my own arrangements. I’ll be pissing in bottles.,0
"It’s not us spinning, Shiv. It’s – just – general cultural bile.",0
"Yeah. Testing at twenty-six. Estimating three weeks of reshoots, which is thirty mil plus forty more on CGI.",0
"And, Shiv … I’m confused – are you offended that there’s messy write-ups about Dad, or that you’re not mentioned enough in these fuck-pies?",1
"Shiv, we’re trying to prep to get inside his head and squeeze every nickel out of this while keeping the numbers straight across five fucking divisions.",0
He’s doing good. He’s doing fine. But just in case that would be a nice thing?,0
Vans makes me car sick. I’m a little nervous – and you know what happens to my guts.,0
"You nervous, Ken?",0
"I’m going to jerk off over it staring at you, you like that?",1
"And by the way, what was all the shouting?",0
Okay. The shouting was the shouting? Great. Thanks.,1
We’re good. Good with the plan.,0
"Sure you have, Ger—",1
"Increasing exponentially with each additional dollar until such time as Karl creams his jeans, while dropping in his golden parachute.",1
"Marcia’s been in with Dad, she’s talking about a kilt?",0
"Send photos? He’s not taking him to the beach, Ken.",0
Oh please. Let’s get it done.,0
Hey. Not like our dad died yesterday. It was actually a couple of days ago so—,1
Right. Yeah. Sure. Um …,1
"I see your ‘soccer men’, the Manchester Red Devils, did a win. Congrats.",0
So what’s the uh— In terms of schedule—?,0
"Well. We’ve come to say, we like your offer, but we don’t as yet think it reflects a full valuation of the potential of what you’re purchasing.",0
"Our key growth drivers are unaffected by our father’s passing, the dip is the dip, it’s nothing— [fundamental.]",0
"Well, ATN isn’t on the table. Dad carved it out.",0
Why?,0
"Er, I don’t think we’re at ‘price’—",0
"We just, we weren’t expecting that. And I’m not sure it works?",0
We’re not sure it does work.,0
We say? Yeah?,0
Offer is one eight-seven. But he wants ATN.,0
"Yeah yeah we did amazing, butter our cocks and serve them with zucchini.",1
"I dunno, not sure that’s how he thinks.",0
You think he really wants ATN? Or is it a move so we ask to subtract and he goes low?,0
"Well we want to keep it. Right? Do Dad’s deal. Keep ATN, add PGN? Me, you and Shiv. Three Fuckateers.",0
I did not know that.,0
I don’t know. Cyd? Cyd’s in operational charge. What? It’s a mutual back-scratch. Mencken wins—,0
"Mencken wins, with us pulling for him. Lot of upside.",0
I mean it is also Dad’s pride and joy he died trying to keep?,0
It’s a gold mine. Maybe keep the gold mine?,1
You don’t fly Hugo to Norway if you don’t want to make a deal.,0
"Well, me and Ken have done a pretty good job.",0
Price has stabilized. Markets seem to like us.,0
Dad wanted to keep ATN.,0
"Bankers will give that number an amber, so we have room for maneuver.",0
‘The Quad’?,1
"We’re running the numbers but, we’d like to explore options for us keeping ATN.",0
We want to hear you on price on the Dad deal. No ATN.,0
"Uh-huh no sure, but we kind of do.",0
Fat wallets.,0
"We don’t mind, dude, that’s cool. Fucking Abba – man.",0
"Okay, Popeye, let us check in and take this back to the board. Because – we would hate this to break down.",0
"Um, yeah. I don’t know. Not great. But also, I guess, that’s the thing, right? We’re selling. It’s like, have we won or lost? It’s kind of hard to tell.",0
And keep ATN?,0
That’s – quite a high-risk piece of fucking sword-swallowing?,1
Everyone wants the deal. Dad did it.,0
Blow it up though? Could be fatal.,0
Wanna chew it with Shivvy?,0
"I mean no, obviously not. But, um—",0
It is Dad’s deal. I feel – fucking – do the deal. Finish his breakfast. I mean what would he do?,0
"We need to make him walk. Right? But so he feels like it’s his call. Cos if the Old Guard smell that we’re getting smart, they’ll shit their beans – go crying to the board. We’re toast.",0
Why does that make you smile? That shouldn’t make you smile. Who likes tightrope walking a straight razor?!,0
Con’s asking if we want a lock of Dad’s hair?,1
Did they take it already? Cos if they haven’t tell them not to. I don’t want them – plucking him like a turkey.,0
"Wait – why are we doing face and hair? It’s closed-casket, correct? Connor, the casket will be closed, correct?",0
"Okay, well – like, Dad hair. Normal coloring. No blusher, no eyeliner. Happy?",0
"Oh my god. Do you even … Will he even … No. What’s he gonna do, enjoy the fucking view?",1
Okay. Let’s do it. Let’s tank it. Let’s fucking do it.,0
We heard you were getting close with Lukas last night?,0
Up on the ridge. Crunch time.,0
Ugh.,0
"From Con. It’s Dad. But it’s not Dad. Oh, man. Oh, man.",0
Do you wanna see?,0
It’s all going to be fine is the headline.,1
". The first two hours are basically a sleeping robot. We can fix it. We’re taking control of the cut. But the lowdown – it’s spiraling, and tomorrow, soon there will be a press thing about it being – you know. ‘In crisis’ or whatever, it’s fine. Hollywood, always in fucking crisis, right? Their favorite vegan cantina closes – crisis.",1
"We have the election, then there’ll be the transition. And we have some relationships, so in terms of the regulatory [issues we’d face]—",0
Okay. Pedant’s corner – Dad was not a prick.,0
I was just thinking – remember? When you asked me when my dad was going to die?,1
"Uh-huh. But you really couldn’t fucking reschedule? Ah? You couldn’t push by a fucking week? My sister’s fucked. My brother’s a mess. I’m fucking dead and you drag us out here, you inhuman fucking – dogman?",1
"You fucking killed him. You ground things out for six months, you drained his life, and then you made us come over here because you couldn’t wait a few more fucking days?",0
"We’re not selling. Okay? We’ll grind you down, sand in the gears, every email takes six months and we’ll all waste hundreds of millions of dollars and in the end you’ll get bored.",0
Yeah. I fucking hate you. And if you tell the board I said any of this I’ll say it was a negotiating tactic. And maybe it is. But it isn’t. So fuck you.,0
"Yeah, well, the plan sucked.",0
Jess – I need to make a pee-pee. Could you bottle me?,0
"Yo, cucks! Ger-Bear! Say how do you fare, oh world’s biggest square?",0
Oh good. Tired. Tired.,0
"Oh sure. . Say, listen, G-Spot. Can I get two? Yeah, just been meaning to say for a while? An apology.",0
"What? For everything. Like in your bathroom. My psychosexual whatever stuff. Hang-ups, act-outs.",0
"Sure. But – that was all kinda, embarrassing. Childish. Tabs is in town. And maybe it’s the grief, or whatever, but I’m just – feeling very, potent.",0
"I’m exhausted to be honest, Ger. From all the heteronormative vanilla ‘how’s ya father’. Will you nudge me if I drop off?",0
"Look. I just have some perspective and it’s a horrible time but maybe I’m getting through some stuff, so?",0
"Your favorite kind of exciting. Look, we’re pleased with the offer we extracted. Price is great.",0
Long story short. Matsson exhibited some – what you’d call erratic behavior. That got us concerned.,0
"We were pushing him, gently, on what we wanted, how much, and – how would you describe it, Ken?",0
Right. He pulled a fuckabout. Carnival of bile and bullshit.,0
"He started shouting about how, we didn’t know what a good deal was, how he didn’t even especially want the deal—",0
"It was his SLT who liked the deal, we ‘better take what was on the table’.",0
"It wasn’t coherent. He was like, saying he was stringing us along and he’d pull the deal and come back when we were weakened or leave us to bleed out.",0
"Honestly, I don’t know. He was maybe getting cold feet and wanted us to walk was how it felt?",0
"Okay, well. Good.",0
Absolutely.,0
"Vanity stopped us, maybe – we were proud of the deal from raising it earlier so—",0
What?,0
What?,0
?,0
No.,0
"Thanks, man.",1
"It did go nuts on the mountain, Shiv. He was talking shit about Dad.",0
We left you out cos we thought it was for the best for [you to be able to claim]—,0
"This was groundwork. We need you. Gonna be cold for us up there, pitching.",0
"Hey, Shiv? I am sorry. We are.",0
One of these?,0
"Okay. We should break this up, cos I’m in heat like a German Shepherd and I’ll poke one of your eyes out with my hard-on.",0
And what you think on Matsson. If the Operation ‘Fruit Loop’ doesn’t fly?,0
"Matsson doesn’t have juice past one-nine-two, Tellis says?",0
"I’ll call one-eight-hundred White Knights, ‘Wanna overpay for something we don’t want to give you?’ Something about this all does depress me.",1
"‘Enhanced medical monitoring’. Ugh. I can smell the boiled cabbage. I’m not saying I want to dance – but the pitch, it needs freshening, tightening. Like your vagina.",0
Maybe I’ll ask fucking Joy Palmer if the fucking  director can come on board and make it all more confusing and loud?,1
Oh sure. Green lights all the way down Sunset. Even she must be able to get a mega-hit from a couple of extra content bil. She’s gotten risk averse from working the turkey farm.,1
"Oh yeah, I’m love-bombing that stuck-up bitch.",1
Hey offer refused. I’ve got all the condolences I need. Yummy. Full.,0
I do.,0
"Well thanks I’m actually okay. I’m largely consolable. So, shall we?",0
Uh-huh. Many thanks. Many.,1
"Why do you care? You gonna come round and eat my yum yums? No, I have Geraint’s place, in the Palisades?",0
Thank you. Thank you re my house.,0
"Lukas? Great. Flaky. Really druggy. Odd. Not focussed. And – yeah, who knows. Honestly, few issues. Sure I can fix but. So! Can’t stand still. I have thoughts.",0
"Yeah. Well, now we’re gonna make some!",0
"Uh-huh, message received. So just to get it out the way, . I just want to understand who’s getting fired for that shit show?",0
"Okay. Well, can’t see that happening again!?",0
You should watch the movie. It needs to lose an hour and find an end.,0
Uh-huh? I guess my thing is should we maybe have been alive to the limited dramatic possibilities provided by a hibernation. Even a really big one?,0
"Look, Joy, I’m turning on the money hose. We want to back you. I just need to hear you’re confident you can get the hit machine pumping?",0
Uh-huh. Well got it. Oh you want more?,0
From what? It’s an election.,0
"Mmm mmm mmm. Mencken’s IP just like anything. Yeah? I don’t like him. You don’t like him, but, what we gonna do?",1
"I know – love the values. Incredibly evolved, ruthlessly segregated city you’ve built on your geological fault here.",1
"I feel like you’re not listening to me, Joy. I want to dump a ton of money on you, but we want to get the hit pump pumping. Balance between streaming and theatrical. Franchise creation, international marketing.",0
"Okay. Look. Joy, I get it. You’re thinking what the fuck does this guy know about anything? He’s not his dad he can’t do it, Roman’s track record is bullshit.",0
"But I could also fire you so – oh no you’re thinking he’s freaking out and saying crazy shit, is he spinning out? Well I’m not, or am I? Poor little boy just wants to call his daddy— ‘Uh Dad I’m with that exec you hated, what do I do? Oh you’re dead?’",0
"Yeah. Yeah. Um, good. I think. Good.",0
In here.,0
Tell him you’re getting plucked. It’s the rapture. The Last Temptation of Greg.,0
"You okay with this, gigantic listening device?",0
Don’t think we can pull that statue down right now. His dick’s too golden.,0
"Hey, Doctor Sarcasmo, did we ask you to squeak? Stand easy, pitch wall.",1
Chase him out of town on price? Okay?,0
Living Plus?,0
Why not forever?,1
Live more forever. Pitch bot? Is it dope?,1
"The numbers aren’t there yet. What can we go to, fracking the silver dollar?",0
"And one of Karl’s droids. And Shiv, we fold in Shiv, right?",0
"I like it. I mean I’m not crazy myself, about dying.",1
I can’t help thinking it was kind of – not— It was very— I didn’t see it coming. For Dad.,0
And I think people will be very intrigued if there’s another way through the whole situation?,0
"Life, death, yeah. Yeah. Get loaded onto a chip. Fired up someone’s ass. Float around as a gas. Live in a tortoise. There has to be ways through. Death just feels very ‘one size fits all’?",0
Hey. So what is it. I’m busy.,0
Yeah. I fired her. Why?,0
"Er, except, I can, cos I did?",0
I did not fire her I just said she was fired to her.,1
"She’s not gonna be on the street. We’ll kick her up to international or she walks with a fat producer deal, you can start the sweep-up, G.",0
Yeah. Gangster. I might poach Kagan. Twenty years younger and thirty times hungrier.,0
It’s what Dad would have done.,0
"Well, I’m what’s left.",0
Gerri. Here’s our thing. You hauling me out of things. Telling me to reconsider good calls. Using the ‘F-word’ freely. It feels disrespectful.,0
I need you to believe I am as good as my dad. Can you?,0
"Look at it this way, I have to believe you believe it. So?",0
You don’t treat me with sufficient respect. And that’s a problem.,0
Maybe I’ll fire .,0
So?,0
Fuck Matsson.,0
This is a simple business decision. You’re not good at your job. Maybe my dad did know? Maybe I am firing you for a list of failures that I choose not to outline. But including a failure to close off our liabilities vis-à-vis claims against Waystar Cruises in a timely manner. Maybe that will play nice?,1
"Let’s get started on that paperwork, Ger, shall we? You gonna do it yourself or shall we get someone a bit fucking sharper on it?",1
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.,0
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Cool. Yeah. But yeah, you should know I think we should let go of Joy.",0
"Yeah, she oversaw , she’s running a fucking cult over there, we should get Jeff to run it?",0
And also Gerri told me not to. So I fired Gerri.,0
"Yeah, but maybe we pull back on that. I dunno. You might have to smooth over, whatever.",0
It feels big. It does feel maybe a bit big.,0
Tabs. Hey.,0
"I’m actually, I’m good.",0
Sure. Little wonked. Work shit and – yeah. Stuff?,0
Nah. No. No I’m staying ahead of the sadness. Nope. Dad can’t run fast enough to catch me. He’s dead. ‘Haha.’,1
Whoa. Easy there.,0
"Easy, Doctor Freud. I’m fine. Humping like an absolute monster.",1
I mean it would be dumb to say my dad died and my dick started working … but …,0
"Look, let’s stop talking, you look offensively dope. If you’re so sorry for me, can we not go do the naughty thing grown-ups do again?",0
So. Ah? I ought to get back. But. Yeah?,0
"More, Oliver? Never before has a girl wanted more!",1
My. Somebody is a greedy goose. Aren’t you still full from earlier?,0
"Uh, think you’re describing sex there, Tab. Doing it.",1
"Middle is the important bit. You can’t say I didn’t do that. The peni entered the vagini. Sex was completed. Sticker please, Mommy!",0
The bit where we lose control and start flopping around like a couple of salmons in a tub? We can do that in private.,1
Why are you being a bitch?,0
"You do whatever disgusting thing you need to do. Go and fucking frig yourself with your sticky fucking toothbrush in the bathroom, Tabs.",0
"The numbers? The numbers on units and projected sales, Ken, where did they— Where did you get them from?",0
From up there?,1
Uh-huh.,1
Uh-huh. Yeah words are okay.,1
I think it’ll be okay.,0
"It’s not him, Shiv. It’s a file on a computer. It’s zeroes and ones. He’s working on synthetic clouds.",1
Joy. Yes. Gerri. Not exactly. It was Dad. It was a warning. Kick her to the foundation. Might be difficult to row back while maintaining authority.,0
I think it is a decent play.,0
It’s high-risk. But I think we have to back it.,0
I think he might need me. I think I have to go for it.,0
How’s it going?,0
Oh yeah?,0
"Yeah. And I was just – I was thinking, they’re great and everything, I like them, I do. But—",0
"I wonder if we should do this. Maybe we should postpone? Hey, dude, no, it’s okay. Or – maybe we dump it on Ray? It’s his division. But not do the whole—",0
"I know, but, I wonder if the idea, isn’t a bit— I wonder if I can sell it?",0
No! Just. Pitching fucking playhouses and living forever and doubling all the numbers up—,0
Sure. No. I know it. I just think maybe I should leave it to you. You have all the words. And the skills. I just think it’s your vision. I might fuck it.,0
Dunno. You don’t want to raincheck this – see what else turns up?,0
"No. I think she’s out. Sensible Susan. I dunno. Good luck, man. Good luck.",0
It’s gonna be great. You’ll kill it. Seriously.,0
Big shoes? Big hat? Big nervous breakdown?,1
No. No way!,0
Aaaaargghhhhh.,0
She said while watching the fuck out of it. And getting turned on. I can hear how wet you are. It’s gross.,1
"Also, by Dad, ‘Bleeding the Brain-Dead Dry’. ‘Florida for Fuckheads’.",1
I mean I would like that? Can we do that?,0
How’s the buzz?,0
"Is that, that’s a very nasty … joke, right?",1
Great work. Proud of you.,0
Okay? Motherfucker deleted it. He deleted the fucking tweet.,0
"I can’t show you, dipshit, cos it’s fucking deleted.",0
"Well thanks, sis. Thanks. Saved me. Thank god you saved me. That could have been me.",1
Wow. Again?,0
"And do what? Sit there, like I’m feeding the ducks?",1
"Oh that’s why you’re perky? Very exciting. I’m sure your Red Guards are all – you know, ready to come round up the thought criminals and turn the police stations into cuddle puddles.",1
Carried!,0
I have no clue. If I want to – I will but I might not. Okay?,0
"Get our story straight? ‘Lovely guy, six-foot-five, wouldn’t say boo to a goose, very fond of ham.’",1
"Uh-huh, your usual ‘malign influence’ material?",1
"Well, because. It worked, in LA. Hats off to the Greatest Showman here— and apologies for the wibble wobble and all due congratulations but—",0
"Exactly – and we think it’s regulatory. We go hard on regulatory. DOJ, FTC, FCC, EU.",0
"Well it was always there but now, poll,  the Dems win – puke – it’s not gonna be too hard to get them to freak about tech overlords ruling the world and destroying the economy and platforming the triggering of the trauma of the whosits.",0
No?,0
And Nate? He’s – right – he’s across competition and he’s tight with the Jiménez folks on that.,0
"Yeah there’s a thing about that but it will be okay. But, yeah – I fired Gerri.",0
"But it wasn’t a real fire, it was a warning fire. I didn’t fire her, I said she was fired to her. It was a power play. I was just putting her back in her box, and she’s so fucking stupid she misunderstood.",0
"It wasn’t anything, Shiv, this will be fine. It’s a Dad play. Keep the generals worried. I’ll fix. I’ll smooth it.",0
I got it.,0
"Thanks. Thanks, Shiv.",0
"Good. What else? You okay on any blowback, from the firings? The bloodlust? Throw Hugo at it?",0
Uh-huh. I used to drop molly and shark for skirt. Now I’m looking to hook up with gray hairs from the Heritage Foundation to talk competition policy.,0
"Yeah, no, but Mencken’s team called.",0
Their internals are even worse.,0
"Um, three or four states where Connor’s one percent is throwing things. It could be pivotal. If he drops, most of his support goes to them. Con’s team is refusing contact. They want me to convince him to drop out?",0
"I guess. I mean, it’s not bad for us to be tight with them? If it did swing his way? Yeah?",0
"Hey, sorry to interrupt. Con, can I grab you? So, listen: kind of a biggie. A bit last-minute, but, Mencken’s team called. And they want to know if you might be willing to drop out?",0
Yes of the election.,0
Yeah it might be too late to physically remove your name from ballots. But if you were to make a statement? Divert the Conhead stream towards the Mencken river?,0
"Um, they said, maybe for the good of the Republic?",1
"No? I mean, you don’t want to be the guy who won it for the Dems? They want to, you know, decriminalize crime and – tax your taxes.",0
Okay then I have also been authorized to make the follow-up offer which is: how familiar are you with ‘Mogadishu’?,0
Because he’s very impressed with your talents and he was thinking maybe you’d fit for an ambassadorial appointment?,0
Con. Yeah? State dinners. ‘Your excellency’.,0
"She came. That’s good. You smoothed that for me, General Franco?",0
"I guess, Dad invited, and he emailed a ‘yes’ like four minutes before walking in?",0
"I mean, we can’t afford to be seen treating him as an enemy?",0
"What’s his game? He going for a freak-out, or is he flicking the same beans as us?",0
"Right. Guide him away from the high-value targets, the meaty loot boxes?",0
Unless he gets sloppy and gropey in which case lead him directly to the editor of  and do not pass ‘Go’. Yeah?,0
"Okay, well … let me see.",0
Well I think they could talk Slovenia or Slovakia?,0
Top-ten GDP? Major geopolitical player? I think it’s tough.,0
"Con, they’re not gonna put you anywhere with nukes.",0
"Okay, and how familiar are you with Oman?",0
"Oman. The cradle of civilization. Probably. ‘The Venice of … the desert’. Fresh dates, fresh oil and fresh oppression?",1
"Mencken man, eh? Anyway I guess it’s out of our hands but – once he gets his mitts on ATN? Swede? ‘Tonight at eight, Reparations Hour with Hurdy Gurdy Third Sex’.",0
"Okay, well. That’s some top-shelf fucking of the rat. Hey. The deep-dive dredged up some filthy doubloons. Matsson’s been creeping on Ebba, his comms. Harassment sloppy spaghetti. Maybe sending her wackadoo shit – bits of hair and blood?",0
Wanna hear something nasty about someone terrible?,0
Yeah? You gonna go turn Wyoming purple with the strength of your big blue dick?,1
We can make primetime safe for you. All we need is one sentence signaling to the market that Jiménez is skeptical? We’ll write it up for you!,0
Totally.,1
Yeah we don’t stand for that. I’m sure you know his record on this stuff? Ally.,0
"Because of the – sending you, and whatnot?",0
Right. Because?,0
"I think I know this, but what are – the details here?",0
May we? CEO shit?,0
Ebba spilled. Screwy metrics in India.,0
"We think so, yeah. Yeah.",0
Hey. So. Can we talk? I have some thoughts to run and wouldn’t mind advice.,0
Hey. Gerri? Ger?,0
Listen. About me firing you. That wasn’t real.,0
"No. That was heat-of-the-moment, you know?",0
"C’mon. Gerri? Yeah. Let’s go and chat. I can stand in a cupboard and jerk off and you can explain to me what the SEC is. Too soon? What do you want? Sorries, cos I got sorries. ‘So very sorry, Your Highness.’",0
Bullshit.,0
"C’mon. Dad fired people all the time, I was just feeling a bit ‘fire- y’, okay?",0
Ooooh. Robo-Gerri! Scary!,0
"Um, well, no.",0
Why are you being a sucky baby?,0
Blurgh. Don’t even.,0
"Oooh, girl power!",1
"‘The story’! No one cares, Gerri.",0
‘I’d like to see your bullet points.’,0
"Yeah. Well. It was just a real pleasure working with you, Gerri.",1
"Oh you bet, Gerri. Maybe the National Guard should be present too and McGruff the fucking Crime Dog?",1
"Hey, man, excuse me. Excuse us. Can we settle this?",0
Oh please. The pop-pops in Phoenix? A wastepaper basket caught fire. I heard a file cabinet’s in the ICU. Con. Can we draft?,1
"Connor, you got your bauble, now let’s do a fucking statement yeah and wind up the old fax machine and fart it out to your oddball army, yeah?",0
You tried. You flopped. Find a new thing.,0
I know. Please stop.,0
Nothing will happen. You’ll be a freckle on the scrotum of eternity.,0
"Con, man. Eat the fucking carrot, bro. Yeah? Everyone in this room thinks you’re a joke. So tell Willa to shut up, cover her shoulders and pack a fucking bag for Oman. Yeah?",0
Yeah sure. You gonna tweet this?,1
"Um. Yeah, probably not.",0
Fuck it. Yeah.,0
Lot of faith in you.,1
You okay?,0
There she is! The Red Baron claims another kill! Hey.,1
"Hey, fuck you I tried. You shoulda kissed more babies, you freak. Shoulda used your tongue.",1
Uh-huh. May I invite you to bite me?,1
Guess so.,0
Better luck next time!,0
"Hey, swell shindig, sis. A peerless assemblage of assholes.",0
"So, hey? Funeral? If no one wants to grab it, happy to take the main energy spot?",0
Yeah. No problem. I got it. Seemed like no one wanted to say. Happy? I’ve just had some thoughts – appearing and— Yeah.,0
Well I got eggplant eggplant flag from Mencken.,0
Four smileys is symptomatic of the complacency at the heart of his out-of-touch campaign.,0
"It’s fun! My team is playing your team. It’s just spicy because, my team wins, they’re gonna shoot your team.",0
The fun buses? The victory vans.,1
"Tabs. Yeah they’re calling it for Jiménez. Big turnout. Few things. But yeah, get offshore! Get offshore, baby!",0
"Jiménez wins, I guess, he waves through the deal, does he? And we— I guess, last-ditch is board or shareholders. Okay? Jeryd wants face-to-face?",0
Should you try Gil or direct to Jiménez?,0
"I guess – today is the day the rooster puts its head in our hands, right? The hosepipe goes through our hands … moment of maximum leverage? He says it might be a bit tight over there for two of us?",0
Hey hey hey. Look at you! Losing it like a massive loser.,1
"Hey, fuck you. I keep my hands out. So, what is this. Cos I’m busy.",0
Fuck you. Yes. What? I don’t run around town like a fucking food-bike guy you know?,0
"Okay? Like: ‘insurgent campaign, unfairly maligned as extremist by the coastal masturbation factories’.",1
"Hey, ‘Even if you’re not going to be  president, you’re going to be  president.’",0
Hey. You got this about Antifa firebombing in Milwaukee?,0
False flag? Could be.,0
But ballots have been lost?,0
"Just a pop-in, what’s going on? They’ve evacuated the count center, right?",0
Nothing. Tom thinks China has hacked his tech.,0
"We’ll see that and what’s going on, then – back upstairs, okay?",0
"You want us to kill him, I’d love to kill him?",0
For me it comes down to coupla old favorites. The Blacks or the Jews. Kidding. I’m !,0
"Yeah, somewhat busy, perhaps.",1
That was kind of a yesterday offer. If he doesn’t make this. You’re going to be partially fucking responsible. Okay?,0
"Your rhymes are compelling. But what’s in it for him, Con?",1
Mencken says we’re done. Wisconsin is done. That’s their position.,0
Go forward to undermine Mencken’s lead?,0
"They can count all the votes they have. However, unfortunately, some have been lost. So.",0
"We literally don’t know that. It could very very easily have been your fucks, they love fires. 11:05 P.M.",0
"Or, your guys knew they were going to lose, so they did something crazy to call it into question and get a revote.",0
Maybe I do?,0
Well why are you getting so uppity about this shit if you’re so confident?,0
"Listen, let’s get real. Jiménez won’t block the GoJo deal, so fuck him. Yeah?",0
Okay? Wow. Well? Can’t get outflanked. And we want to be fast? We’re gonna need to call it right?,0
And?,0
Well we’re not waiting for the burnt votes. So you can call it.,0
Exactly. You can’t do it. Boom. Mencken. Thank you!,0
They’re gone! We can’t know what was on those ballots.,0
"You know, what they  have been, but we don’t .",0
Well you don’t know.,0
How do you know?,0
You don’t know. Why do you know?! Cos you’re so ‘plugged in’ you know how all the little peasants vote and what’s in everyone’s heart? Well no.,0
Ballots get lost every election. There’s no way to get burnt ballots back.,0
"It’s not for us in here to say how they will have voted? I mean why don’t we just run your model and not bother with all the – people, huh? Is that what you’re saying?",0
"Historically people used to burn witches, should we start doing that?",1
"So, the fire was biased? ‘Fire favors GOP’ claims mad witch?",1
"They can’t rerun the election, right? If the Right got wrongly blamed for this, what would that do? If the Left did? Could get nasty?",0
"I am going to the bathroom, to shit? Do you want me to livestream it?",1
‘Powerful commentary’. Heh?,1
"So? Look, Mencken will block the deal. But he’ll kill it, if he wins he’s willing to refer it to FTC, whatever, new law, foreign ownership tightened, whatever, he’ll screw it up, in exchange for our support tonight.",0
"Hey thanks for this, guys, so. We have the votes. Can’t rerun fairly, can’t let Lefty terrorism affect the thing. Let’s call it.",0
"By the power of me, the CEO of Waystar telling you what to put onto the telly-box mouth people.",0
"I think we can, Dar.",0
"Look, we have outstanding states. Michigan, in Ohio, Georgia, Arizona. It’s not that big a deal.",0
"Uh-huh and thank you. Everyone respects you, Darwin. But it’s really not a numbers thing.",0
"Uh-huh. Great. But I’m just gonna say, we’re good. It’s on me. The votes that exist have been tallied and they give Mencken the state.",0
"We’ll be making the call together, Tom.",0
"Look, I don’t want to make you do anything. But what if we were to say, this is the situation in Wisconsin, how would it feel if we said it wasn’t a – a call-call, but a call – that was—",0
"You could explain, we could get the camera, in on you and you can explain?",0
What is it? Are you—?,0
What?,0
We’re good.,0
"Are you okay to call it, Darwin?",0
"And that, that would be it, right?",0
"But I mean, if PGN is going to call it?",0
"We called Wisconsin, that’s over, forget that. We can’t un-call it, can we? That would make us all look quite unprofessional.",0
That’s it.,0
Are you gonna pull a big-brother?,0
"Like when, if you wanted roast chicken, and I wanted steak, we always had chicken?",0
I would tantrum cos we never had a fucking steak!,0
Well it was bullshit. I never won. I never won. Always chicken.,0
"Yeah. Basically. Look. If we don’t call for him early, if we don’t get on the train, and he still wins – which is perfectly possible – but without us, tonight, or going legal, think about that? With FVA and VeraNews backing him, we’re left the most dickless eunuchs in cuck town?",0
Nah.,0
We give it to Mencken. Mencken blocks the deal. He’s not fucking wishy-washy. He’s a guy.,0
‘Oh America!’,1
What would Dad do?,0
C’mon! The guy in the pocket? The guy who’s gonna answer our calls? The fucking guy who’s gonna print us dollars? It’s all upside.,0
Don’t be a Prissy Peter? Maybe we could do with a dose of that? Just a nice little dose of the frighteners? Wind shit back twenty?,0
And she’s okay?,0
"Mmm? Sure but think about the fucking – action, the fucking, choo-choo of it. We’ll be in the fucking West Wing. Nothing matters, Ken, nothing matters. Dad’s dead and the country’s a big pussy waiting to get fucked. I’m serious. Let’s get fucking. Do shit! We’re not chin-stroke motherfuckers. Action! We can pay for any damages. Let’s jam our heads in the bosom of history and just— blurghghghg!",0
Oh please?! What? C’mon.,0
Nooo. Man?,0
Oooh. They  be willing to ?? It’s deep-fried bullshit.,0
"Sorry. No. Game over. C’mon, we have to call it. It’s cast-iron from Mencken.",0
Dad did what the fuck he wanted. One fax and he took a government out. ‘Screw Lyle.’ That was enough. Canada. Here. He did what he wanted.,0
Only ones he’d started. He didn’t give a fuck!,0
Can’t have uncertainty. The markets. The chaos of trying to rerun an election could send the country into meltdown.,0
Can’t have uncertainty. China is coming.,0
"It’s not the final – final, anyway. There’s court shit and— It’ll fuzz along. It’s just—",0
What they give you. What they promise you – unlimited social security spending with this one weird trick?,1
What?,0
Have you got a side deal?,0
"Well. Mencken. It’s Mencken, right?",0
Tommy Two-Tits!,1
Will no one think of the children!,1
"‘A time, in the affairs of man, to get fucky-fucky with Matsson’?",0
"You’re boring, Shiv.",0
"And, you don’t have a pass for in here.",0
"No you don’t have a pass for down here, just as a matter of fact.",0
If you keep on talking hysterical shit we might have to ask you to move. People are trying to do serious work.,0
"Nah, it’s because you’ve broken up with your boyfriend.",0
Tom. Call it. We can call it.,0
"We called Wisconsin. Now we call Arizona, so we call the election.",0
No one knows what you mean! No one cares. No one cares!!,0
He’s gonna play ball. You should hear him talk semiconductors.,0
"We’ve just made a night of good TV, that’s what we’ve done. Nothing happens.",0
Oooh. President calling. Cool. Yo. Hocus-POTUS. You sitting in the POTUS position? Whuddup.,0
"Yeah I’m okay. I’m good. I’m actually, honestly, I’m excited. Sicko right? But. Mencken wins. Kills the deal. I mean, it’s just ,!",0
"You don’t like these fucking ratings, dude? ‘Conflict is Bonflict.’",0
"Uh-huh. My thing, for today, is, and good to check in, but, the board all there? Time to poison the well on Matsson, right? Whichever way the courts go. Kill it before Jeryd even has to do anything political. Get into all those fucking saggy old board earlobes. Waystar stock’s up. Political connections secure. Get them all jangled up and frightened off – so we never even need to take it to a board vote.",0
He’d fucking love it! We might get him out of the box if he knows there’s a little bit of fucking afoot?!,0
See you at Shivvy’s yeah? To roll deep?,0
It’s fine. Just been sitting here with Lady Liberty crying for all the taxes she won’t be able to pay.,1
I can say what I like. What you did was terrible. You betrayed us.,0
You’re sore. Because Mencken is smart and will never let a foreigner run our wonderful company.,0
"Is Matsson? Doesn’t know when he’s beat. You should be pleased. Mencken wins and blocks the deal, we stay in charge.",0
"Well, the idea is a family – family – situation. So. Big picture. All is good.",0
Well that’s dumb. And shitty.,0
You get Mom’s invitation for ‘a Caribbean air-clear’?,0
Is it mine?,1
You’re having a Wambsgland? I thought you’d just been eating your feelings.,0
"You know, I’m not going to stop— [doing jokes.] I see you breastfeeding I  going to jerk off.",1
What? I’m pleased! One less sibling to compete with.,0
"Pregnant chess pieces can’t play chess, Shiv. Too heavy. They just fall over and roll off the board.",0
"Yet again your arch-nemesis, your vagina, has foiled you.",0
What? Funeral truce?,0
Congratulations.,1
What sort of threats?,0
Well we’re not the ones who have made the day all about ourselves and all the cum we’ve hoarded are we?,1
Happy Funeral.,1
"Glasses. Smart. You can cry in secret, hide all emotion, and thus emerge, victorious, as the winner of the funeral.",0
"So, there was a warning someone was gonna try to zip-tie themselves to the casket? Lovely folks you got out there.",1
"It’s fine. Nearly here. I’m gonna do a little bit of – handshaking, okay?",0
"I hope you’re not going to get all bitter. With a sour little white- woman life, moaning about gerrymandering and researching which garbanzos are most organic. —",0
"Yeah, Frank pal. Hey. We’ve had our battles huh, but – this – puts it in perspective don’t it?",0
"Nothing. Just an observation. I think Ken’s lost his stomach for the fight. He’s getting kinda teary about ‘the Republic’. Too much late-night Ken Burns. Which is lovely. But Mencken is gonna block the deal. And if Ken’s lost his stomach for the fight – which I really hope he hasn’t – well, if there’s gonna just be one cherry on the cake. I’ll be, you know, rounding up a posse?",0
Gregory.,0
Mencken?!,0
"Maybe. Later. You’re on Ewan watch. Okay? He wanted to speak but – sadly— no time. So. Yeah? He starts unfurling a banner or singing union songs, license to kill.",0
"Hello, fellow saddos. How are you holding up?",0
"Yeah, Karl, I just wanted to talk to you. On options if and when the deal gets blocked. How I see things. Because, I really think – don’t know how this can be put to the board for a final decision with all the uncertainty? Mencken would block foreign ownership. So, I wonder, if in terms of planning, we don’t wait for the courts and just – chart our own course?",0
"C’mon? How many salmon can you catch, Karl? It’s the same fucking fish the Parks Service ships around the country for old- timers to hook? Wouldn’t you like to boss a young fucking numbskull around the halls of power?",0
"Hello, Peter.",0
"Here? Um, no.",0
"Who have you hit? Because, it’s great that Mencken’s a racist and won’t let a dirty foreigner buy the company, but I still think we need to get the board and brass rallying round the poor orphans here. Right?",0
"Marcia’s looking chic. Hubba hubba. What? She’s a sexy woman. A sexy funeral lady. Dude, I tell you what, if you are weirded out by that, wait till I have sex with Marcia, on Dad’s coffin. Ken. C’mon, we both know one of us will, it’s tribal. It has to happen.",0
Could we bump Frank and you do first reading?,0
Greg? Stop him.,0
I’m good. I might try to make a pass at Marcia as I go.,0
Pre-grieved. I already gave at the office.,0
"My fath— Logan Ro— was a grea ma— in the true senses, sense— I, um I loved my— And … He’s gone, but— I’m sorr—",0
I can’t. Is he in there? Can we get him out?,0
I’m sorry.,0
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Man. I don’t know what happened. Fuck.,0
I got hit by a wave.,0
"I fucked it, huh?",0
No?,0
These hard – these stone-cold money fucks?,1
Funeral is a freebie?,0
"Thanks, Ger.",0
"Yeah, fuck off.",0
"Oh, man.",0
He made me breathe funny.,0
What the fuck was that?,0
With what?,0
"Man oh man. It’s too much, man.",0
"Hey, Daddy Long Legs. Go and kick your grandpa will you?",0
Big-boy talk. Fuck off. Yeah?,0
Just – in touch with my emotions unlike you psychopaths.,0
Well have fun jerking off to that.,1
Look at her. In her fucking pomp. Fucking glowing. All dope and one in the chamber.,0
If only we could put my fighty sperm in your working dick or sew your working dick on to me instead of my broken one?,0
Nah. No.,0
We have an agreement. He’ll block because—,0
I don’t feel so good.,0
Hey. C’mon.,0
"Well, no. If he welches on the deal to block – we can – we can – we can hurt him with ATN, cry foul—",0
But—,0
Um.,0
What’s up? All good?,0
"Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you! Fuck you fuck you fuck you pricks. Fuck you all, fuck you all.",0
Fuck you. *  I quite wanted to give Roman this moment of comfort but in the cut he seemed too far gone to be reached. †  We had to put Matsson in a car because of some scheduling issues – but it turned out to be a good way to construct the scene. Episode Ten,0
I’m fine. I’m good. ‘You should see the other guy.’ Not a scratch on him – but huge issues with toxic masculinity.,1
Just – got into a discussion with some of your pals about the merits of liberal democracy.,1
True. Peter did my eyedrops.,0
"Fuck you, fragile. What?",0
"Well no, fuck you, don’t talk to me like that. You’re fucked. We’re fucked. So don’t bullshit me.",0
Well not looking after—,0
Yeah well ‘sorry’. I don’t give a fuck. I don’t care.,0
"Well fuck you sorry but you’re a clown living in a dream world. You don’t have it. You don’t have it. You don’t have it you don’t have it, so why are you trying to – fucking, get into me?",0
"Roman needs everyone to fuck off. I’m fine. I had a very violent fight which I won and I am fine, I’m not the fucking sad sack here – so back off.",0
No. Don’t talk to me like that okay? I’m taking a boat out. And don’t follow. I’m gonna be crying and jerking it. My absolute favorites. Just fucking – leave me!,0
"Hey. Look at this, fucking, scorpion party! Who wants a piece of me? Come on, pay a dollar and, take your pop at the human fucking vote. Why don’t I cut my arms off – give you one each to take home with? Then you can fuck off?",1
"That is so thoughtful, you’d like get us a job at the mall so we could learn the value of real money?",1
"Say you love us and win a prize, Ma!",1
Jonathan? Jonathan’s had a hard time? Tell us more!,1
Unbelievable. Did you know about this?,1
"Oh wow, yeah this sounds fascinating!",1
Ken – how?,0
Shiv?,0
Oh fuck. Man. Yeah? For real?,0
Fuck. Who instead?,0
Fuck. So. I mean – okay. Um. Well – okay? I guess. With her. Things are – are back – yeah?,0
Shiv?,0
"Man. Okay. It’s real, yeah?",0
"Did you talk to him, to Lukas?",0
Nothing. We might get— Shall we get someone? Laird or Tellis?,0
You think? You said they were cast-iron.,0
"You can fucking say, man …",0
Who calls us the Fuck-Brother Bandwagon?,0
"Did he get to you, Tellis?",0
And pray tell …,0
I too would be strongly interested in fucking him to death.,0
"Well, Dad said it would be me.",0
"Well, Dad just did say it should be me.",0
"We were getting close again, before, you know this, mostly and – I was texting and he was warm and he said when I was with him, late one night, that it should be me.",0
Hey? C’mon.,0
Enough. Dad – Dad wanted he said—,0
"Well, it’s true. So, I don’t know what to do with that.",0
Pics or it didn’t happen.,0
Yeah well that doesn’t count.,0
And me last.,0
"So, I shed a tear at my father’s funeral and now I’m fucked forever? Didn’t see that in the terms and fucking conditions.",1
Cheesy.,0
"Serious cheeseball, is what you are.",0
Are we actually going in? Cos. You know?,0
"What you think? We could fuck it. Get out? Sell to Matsson, let Lawrence or some business-school dry-cleaner sit in the throne?",0
Uh-huh. It can’t be him. But it really can’t be you.,0
"He’ll be— It will be so terrible. But. I dunno? I can, sort of, unfortunately, see it. Whereas you?",0
"Or he played you like a big fiddle, like a pregnant cello.",0
Meh. So?,0
Which would be – good?,1
Who do you  think Dad wanted to give it to?,0
"I don’t think he wanted to give it to any of us. And he found him kind of annoying. But, probably, closest? Most often? I guess? We give it to him?",0
Unless?,0
Okay? I like killing him. That is intriguing. What would we do?,1
"Roll the seal off the rock. You stand on one end, I stand on the other, till it goes limp. What goes around comes around?",1
"But he’d be such a dick if it went wrong. ‘Dude, did you try to murder me? That’s so not a thing you’re actually meant to do and is not a good thing to do, man!’",0
Shall we? What’s it like. Being pregnant?,0
Is it like being fat? Like just fat at the front?,0
And what’s it like getting big bazzoomas? Do you feel like it might make you fall over?,0
Okay. Just interested.,0
Well don’t tell him!,1
No stomach for the admin.,0
"You get the bauble. Congratulations. It’s haunted and cursed and nothing will ever go right, but, enjoy your bauble.",0
If we’re going to anoint him. First he must complete a task!,0
Eat a spoonful of cinnamon!,0
Yes! We’re gonna make you a meal fit for a king!,1
Oooh. A real bounty!,1
"Mm! Mama, with this pair of sprouting potatoes, zero-percent milk, and wartime pickle you are really spoiling us!",1
"Chuck it in, mate!",0
"Mom, I know how you feel about best-by dates but you have pterodactyl eggs in here. You have soup cans with Andy Warhol’s fingerprints.",0
There’s not a ton of – food. And Ken’s hungry and I’m—,0
We could order in. Do you have a number?,0
"Oh, it’s a bag of frozen knobbies?",0
"‘Bovril and knobbies, sweetheart?’",1
"I’m so sorry, Peter.",1
"‘Oh, I’m sorry, Mummy, I licked it all over. I am so sorry. I can’t stop licking Peter’s cheese. What shall we do?’",1
Congratulations. You fuckhead.,0
Paul’s good. Paul’s rock. Paul doesn’t trust tech.,0
Do we care – do we have time?,0
"We can do thirty? Yeah? To the Great Reallocation! Dewi! Hey, man. Roman.",0
I got Hearts. Does anyone want to swap a soccer team for a bottle of wine?,1
"I dunno, about a thirty-percent return on investment?",1
It’s all going to break down over a letter opener.,0
And who was present at that?,0
"O-kay!? And so – does it all have to go, do you not want to—",0
"And, Con – you don’t want to keep more of it for—",0
"Uh-huh, the second-week itch.",1
"Oh, man. Man? Fucked by the dry-cleaner!",0
Stewy?,0
"I mean it couldn’t be Shiv, because—",0
"Well, yeah it can’t be me, because: ‘Your new CEO: Barfight O’Horrible’.",1
Looks like they’ve heard their testicles might be on fire?,1
"It’s going to be a fairly explosive mega-fuck, so, yes.",0
Sure?,0
What’s she in for?,0
I don’t really wanna see her. Should she be around?,0
Yeah. I don’t really want to see anyone.,0
I might call in. Call in the vote.,0
"Uh-huh. Yeah. It’s better, than I thought. It’s so much better.",0
"I just feel. People are going to be saying, why isn’t it me?",0
Right. It’s just the optics. It’s dumb. The stitches. They’re good stitches.,0
"Uh-huh. I mean, just if – like. If people think I pussied out though, so maybe I won’t—",0
Yeah I just. I look kinda okay? It’s dumb but. Why isn’t it me?,0
"Hey, man? You fucking bastard.",0
I fucking hate you.,0
Nope.,0
"Shiv, are we good? What are you doing?",0
Well – can you do it fast?,0
"Shiv, I fucking jumped. I jumped.",0
"Shiv, you can’t fucking just—?",0
"Fucking let me swing, Shiv, c’mon, I jumped!",0
"Shiv, it’s the fucking plan, I jumped.",0
‘Which?’ Oh you killed so many kids you forgot which one?,1
As in?,0
No.,0
Bullshit.,0
"That was a move? Ken, c’mon?",1
"No, man.",0
Did it happen or not?,0
Fucking bullshit.,0
No.,0
Well she’s the bloodline?,0
She is the bloodline.,0
"No. If you’re gonna play that card, Dad’s view was, yours aren’t real.",0
Not real-real.,0
I am just saying what Dad said.,0
"They are a pair of randos. One is a buy-in, and one is half Rava and half some filing-cabinet guy.",0
"Hey, Ken, no!",0
"It’s bullshit, man. It’s fucking nothing.",0
"It’s fuck all. Bits of glue and broken shows, and phony news and fucking—",0
"It’s just nothing. It’s nothing, it’s fucking nothing.",0
We’re bullshit.,0
"Hey hey hey, whatup, motherfucker.",0
